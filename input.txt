Добрый доктор Айболит!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 3002
Он под деревом сидит.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 3003
Приходи к нему лечиться

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 3004
И корова, и волчица,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 3005
И жучок, и червячок,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 3006
И медведица!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 3007
Всех излечит, исцелит

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 3008
Добрый доктор Айболит!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 3009
И пришла к Айболиту лиса:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 3010
«Ой, меня укусила оса!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 3011
И пришёл к Айболиту барбос:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 3012
«Меня курица клюнула в нос!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 3013
И прибежала зайчиха

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 3014
И закричала: «Ай, ай!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 3015
Мой зайчик попал под трамвай!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 3016
Мой зайчик, мой мальчик

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 3017
Попал под трамвай!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 3018
Он бежал по дорожке,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 3019
И ему перерезало ножки,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 3020
И теперь он больной и хромой,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 3021
Маленький заинька мой!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 3022
И сказал Айболит: «Не беда!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 3023
Подавай-ка его сюда!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 3024
Я пришью ему новые ножки,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 3025
Он опять побежит по дорожке».

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 3026
И принесли к нему зайку,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 3027
Такого больного, хромого,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 3028
И доктор пришил ему ножки,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 3029
И заинька прыгает снова.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 3030
А с ним и зайчиха-мать

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 3031
Тоже пошла танцевать,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 3032
И смеётся она и кричит:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 3033
«Ну, спасибо тебе. Айболит!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 3034
Вдруг откуда-то шакал

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 3035
На кобыле прискакал:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 3036
«Вот вам телеграмма

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 3037
От Гиппопотама!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 3038
«Приезжайте, доктор,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 3039
В Африку скорей

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 4002
Он под деревом сидит.

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 4003
Приходи к нему лечиться

--- PAGE END ---

#TITLE: 4004
И корова, и волчица,

И жучок, и червячок,

Добрый доктор Айболит!

И пришла к Айболиту лиса:

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 4010
«Ой, меня укусила оса!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 4011
И пришёл к Айболиту барбос:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 4012
«Меня курица клюнула в нос!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 4013
И прибежала зайчиха

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 4014
И закричала: «Ай, ай!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 4015
Мой зайчик попал под трамвай!

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 4016
Мой зайчик, мой мальчик

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 4017
Попал под трамвай!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 4018
Он бежал по дорожке,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 4019
И ему перерезало ножки,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 4020
И теперь он больной и хромой,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 4021
Маленький заинька мой!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 4022
И сказал Айболит: «Не беда!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 4023
Подавай-ка его сюда!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 4024
Я пришью ему новые ножки,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 4025
Он опять побежит по дорожке».

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 4026
И принесли к нему зайку,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 4027
Такого больного, хромого,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 4028
И доктор пришил ему ножки,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 4029
И заинька прыгает снова.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 4030
А с ним и зайчиха-мать

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 4031
Тоже пошла танцевать,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 4032
И смеётся она и кричит:

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 4033
«Ну, спасибо тебе. Айболит!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 4034
Вдруг откуда-то шакал

«Что такое? Неужели

Приходите же скорее,

#TITLE: 4212
«Меня курица клюнула в нос!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 4213
И прибежала зайчиха

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 4214
И закричала: «Ай, ай!

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 4215
Мой зайчик попал под трамвай!

#TITLE: 4216
Мой зайчик, мой мальчик

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 4217
Попал под трамвай!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 4218
Он бежал по дорожке,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 4219
И ему перерезало ножки,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 4220
И теперь он больной и хромой,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 4221
Маленький заинька мой!»

#TITLE: 4222
И сказал Айболит: «Не беда!

Подавай-ка его сюда!

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 4224
Я пришью ему новые ножки,

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 4225
Он опять побежит по дорожке».

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 4226
И принесли к нему зайку,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 4227
Такого больного, хромого,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 4228
И доктор пришил ему ножки,

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 4229
И заинька прыгает снова.

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 4230
А с ним и зайчиха-мать

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 4231
Тоже пошла танцевать,

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 4232
И смеётся она и кричит:

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 4233
«Ну, спасибо тебе. Айболит!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 4234
Вдруг откуда-то шакал

На кобыле прискакал:

Приходи к нему лечиться

Добрый доктор Айболит!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 5002
Он под деревом сидит.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 5003
Приходи к нему лечиться

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 5004
И корова, и волчица,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 5005
И жучок, и червячок,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 5006
И медведица!

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 5007
Всех излечит, исцелит

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 5008
Добрый доктор Айболит!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 5009
И пришла к Айболиту лиса:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 5010
«Ой, меня укусила оса!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 5011
И пришёл к Айболиту барбос:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 5012
«Меня курица клюнула в нос!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 5013
И прибежала зайчиха

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 5014
И закричала: «Ай, ай!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 5015
Мой зайчик попал под трамвай!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 5016
Мой зайчик, мой мальчик

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 5017
Попал под трамвай!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 5018
Он бежал по дорожке,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 5019
И ему перерезало ножки,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 5020
И теперь он больной и хромой,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 5021
Маленький заинька мой!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 5022
И сказал Айболит: «Не беда!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 5023
Подавай-ка его сюда!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 5024
Я пришью ему новые ножки,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 5025
Он опять побежит по дорожке».

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 5026
И принесли к нему зайку,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 5027
Такого больного, хромого,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 5028
И доктор пришил ему ножки,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 5029
И заинька прыгает снова.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 5030
А с ним и зайчиха-мать

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 5031
Тоже пошла танцевать,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 5032
И смеётся она и кричит:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 5033
«Ну, спасибо тебе. Айболит!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 5034
Вдруг откуда-то шакал

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 5035
На кобыле прискакал:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 5036
«Вот вам телеграмма

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 5037
От Гиппопотама!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 5038
«Приезжайте, доктор,

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 5039
В Африку скорей

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 5040
И спасите, доктор,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 5041
Наших малышей!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 5042
«Что такое? Неужели

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 5043
Ваши дети заболели?»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 5044
«Да-да-да! У них ангина,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 5045
Скарлатина, холерина,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 5046
Дифтерит, аппендицит,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 5047
Малярия и бронхит!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 5048
Приходите же скорее,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 5049
Добрый доктор Айболит!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 5050
«Ладно, ладно, побегу,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 5051
Вашим детям помогу.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 5052
Только где же вы живёте?

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 5053
На горе или в болоте?»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 5054
«Мы живём на Занзибаре,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 5055
В Калахари и Сахаре,

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 5056
На горе Фернандо-По,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 5059
И встал Айболит, побежал Айболит.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 5060
По полям, по лесам, по лугам он бежит.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 5061
И одно только слово твердит Айболит:

«Лимпопо, Лимпопо, Лимпопо!»

Добрый доктор Айболит!

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 5202
Он под деревом сидит.

Приходи к нему лечиться

И жучок, и червячок,

И пришла к Айболиту лиса:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 5210
«Ой, меня укусила оса!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 5211
И пришёл к Айболиту барбос:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 5212
«Меня курица клюнула в нос!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 5213
И прибежала зайчиха

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 5214
И закричала: «Ай, ай!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 5215
Мой зайчик попал под трамвай!

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 5216
Мой зайчик, мой мальчик

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 5217
Попал под трамвай!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 5218
Он бежал по дорожке,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 5219
И ему перерезало ножки,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 5220
И теперь он больной и хромой,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 5221
Маленький заинька мой!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 5222
И сказал Айболит: «Не беда!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 5223
Подавай-ка его сюда!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 5224
Я пришью ему новые ножки,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 5225
Он опять побежит по дорожке».

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 5226
И принесли к нему зайку,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 5227
Такого больного, хромого,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 5228
И доктор пришил ему ножки,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 5229
И заинька прыгает снова.

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 5230
А с ним и зайчиха-мать

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 5231
Тоже пошла танцевать,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 5232
И смеётся она и кричит:

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 5233
«Ну, спасибо тебе. Айболит!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 5234
Вдруг откуда-то шакал

Добрый доктор Айболит!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 5602
Он под деревом сидит.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 5603
Приходи к нему лечиться

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 5604
И корова, и волчица,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 5605
И жучок, и червячок,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 5606
И медведица!

Всех излечит, исцелит

Добрый доктор Айболит!

И пришла к Айболиту лиса:

«Ой, меня укусила оса!»

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 5611

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 5612
«Меня курица клюнула в нос!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 5613
И прибежала зайчиха

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 5614
И закричала: «Ай, ай!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 5615
Мой зайчик попал под трамвай!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 5616
Мой зайчик, мой мальчик

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 5617
Попал под трамвай!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 5618
Он бежал по дорожке,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 5619
И ему перерезало ножки,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 5620
И теперь он больной и хромой,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 5621
Маленький заинька мой!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 5622
И сказал Айболит: «Не беда!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 5623
Подавай-ка его сюда!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 5624
Я пришью ему новые ножки,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 5625
Он опять побежит по дорожке».

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 5626
И принесли к нему зайку,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 5627
Такого больного, хромого,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 5628
И доктор пришил ему ножки,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 5629
И заинька прыгает снова.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 5630
А с ним и зайчиха-мать

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 5631
Тоже пошла танцевать,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 5632
И смеётся она и кричит:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 5633
«Ну, спасибо тебе. Айболит!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 5634
Вдруг откуда-то шакал

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 5635
На кобыле прискакал:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 5636
«Вот вам телеграмма

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 5637
От Гиппопотама!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 5638
«Приезжайте, доктор,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 5639
В Африку скорей

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 5640
И спасите, доктор,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 5641
Наших малышей!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 5642
«Что такое? Неужели

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 5643
Ваши дети заболели?»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 5644
«Да-да-да! У них ангина,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 5645
Скарлатина, холерина,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 5646
Дифтерит, аппендицит,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 5647
Малярия и бронхит!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 5648
Приходите же скорее,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 5649
Добрый доктор Айболит!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 5650
«Ладно, ладно, побегу,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 5651
Вашим детям помогу.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 5652
Только где же вы живёте?

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 5653
На горе или в болоте?»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 5654
«Мы живём на Занзибаре,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 5655
В Калахари и Сахаре,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 5656
На горе Фернандо-По,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 5657
Где гуляет Гиппо-по

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 5658
По широкой Лимпопо».

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 5659
И встал Айболит, побежал Айболит.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 5660
По полям, по лесам, по лугам он бежит.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 5661
И одно только слово твердит Айболит:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 5662
«Лимпопо, Лимпопо, Лимпопо!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 5663
А в лицо ему ветер, и снег, и град:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 5664
«Эй, Айболит, воротися назад!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 5665
И упал Айболит и лежит на снегу:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 5666
«Я дальше идти не могу».

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 5667
И сейчас же к нему из-за ёлки

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 5668
Выбегают мохнатые волки:

Добрый доктор Айболит!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 6202
Он под деревом сидит.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 6203
Приходи к нему лечиться

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 6204
И корова, и волчица,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 6205
И жучок, и червячок,

И медведица!

Всех излечит, исцелит

И пришла к Айболиту лиса:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 6210
«Ой, меня укусила оса!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 6211
И пришёл к Айболиту барбос:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 6212
«Меня курица клюнула в нос!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 6213
И прибежала зайчиха

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 6214
И закричала: «Ай, ай!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 6215
Мой зайчик попал под трамвай!

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 6216
Мой зайчик, мой мальчик

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 6217
Попал под трамвай!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 6218
Он бежал по дорожке,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 6219
И ему перерезало ножки,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 6220
И теперь он больной и хромой,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 6221
Маленький заинька мой!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 6222
И сказал Айболит: «Не беда!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 6223
Подавай-ка его сюда!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 6224
Я пришью ему новые ножки,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 6225
Он опять побежит по дорожке».

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 6226
И принесли к нему зайку,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 6227
Такого больного, хромого,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 6228
И доктор пришил ему ножки,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 6229
И заинька прыгает снова.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 6230
А с ним и зайчиха-мать

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 6231
Тоже пошла танцевать,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 6232
И смеётся она и кричит:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 6233
«Ну, спасибо тебе. Айболит!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 6234
Вдруг откуда-то шакал

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 6235
На кобыле прискакал:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 6236
«Вот вам телеграмма

От Гиппопотама!»

«Приезжайте, доктор,

#TITLE: 6242
«Что такое? Неужели

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 6243
Ваши дети заболели?»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 6244
«Да-да-да! У них ангина,

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 6245
Скарлатина, холерина,

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 6246
Дифтерит, аппендицит,

Малярия и бронхит!

Приходите же скорее,

#TITLE: 6249
Добрый доктор Айболит!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 6250
«Ладно, ладно, побегу,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 6251
Вашим детям помогу.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 6252
Только где же вы живёте?

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 6253
На горе или в болоте?»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 6254
«Мы живём на Занзибаре,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 6255
В Калахари и Сахаре,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 6256
На горе Фернандо-По,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 6257
Где гуляет Гиппо-по

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 6258
По широкой Лимпопо».

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 6259
И встал Айболит, побежал Айболит.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 6260
По полям, по лесам, по лугам он бежит.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 6261
И одно только слово твердит Айболит:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 6262
«Лимпопо, Лимпопо, Лимпопо!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 6263
А в лицо ему ветер, и снег, и град:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 6264
«Эй, Айболит, воротися назад!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 6265
И упал Айболит и лежит на снегу:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 6266
«Я дальше идти не могу».

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 6267
И сейчас же к нему из-за ёлки

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 6268
Выбегают мохнатые волки:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 6269
«Садись, Айболит, верхом,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 6270
Мы живо тебя довезём!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 6271
И вперёд поскакал Айболит

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 6272
И одно только слово твердит:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 6273
«Лимпопо, Лимпопо, Лимпопо!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 6274
Но вот перед ними море —

#TITLE: 6275
Бушует, шумит на просторе.

На горе Фернандо-По,

По широкой Лимпопо».

#TITLE: 6459
И встал Айболит, побежал Айболит.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 6460
По полям, по лесам, по лугам он бежит.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 6461
И одно только слово твердит Айболит:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 6462
«Лимпопо, Лимпопо, Лимпопо!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 6463
А в лицо ему ветер, и снег, и град:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 6464
«Эй, Айболит, воротися назад!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 6465
И упал Айболит и лежит на снегу:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 6466
«Я дальше идти не могу».

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 6467
И сейчас же к нему из-за ёлки

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 6468
Выбегают мохнатые волки:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 6469
«Садись, Айболит, верхом,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 6470
Мы живо тебя довезём!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 6471
И вперёд поскакал Айболит

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 6472
И одно только слово твердит:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 6473
«Лимпопо, Лимпопо, Лимпопо!»

#TITLE: 6474
Но вот перед ними море —

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 6475
Бушует, шумит на просторе.

А в море высокая ходит волна.

Добрый доктор Айболит!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 6602
Он под деревом сидит.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 6603
Приходи к нему лечиться

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 6604
И корова, и волчица,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 6605
И жучок, и червячок,

И медведица!

Всех излечит, исцелит

Добрый доктор Айболит!

#TITLE: 6609
И пришла к Айболиту лиса:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 6610
«Ой, меня укусила оса!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 6611
И пришёл к Айболиту барбос:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 6612
«Меня курица клюнула в нос!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 6613
И прибежала зайчиха

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 6614
И закричала: «Ай, ай!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 6615
Мой зайчик попал под трамвай!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 6616
Мой зайчик, мой мальчик

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 6617
Попал под трамвай!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 6618
Он бежал по дорожке,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 6619
И ему перерезало ножки,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 6620
И теперь он больной и хромой,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 6621
Маленький заинька мой!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 6622
И сказал Айболит: «Не беда!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 6623
Подавай-ка его сюда!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 6624
Я пришью ему новые ножки,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 6625
Он опять побежит по дорожке».

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 6626
И принесли к нему зайку,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 6627
Такого больного, хромого,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 6628
И доктор пришил ему ножки,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 6629
И заинька прыгает снова.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 6630
А с ним и зайчиха-мать

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 6631
Тоже пошла танцевать,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 6632
И смеётся она и кричит:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 6633
«Ну, спасибо тебе. Айболит!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 6634
Вдруг откуда-то шакал

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 6635
На кобыле прискакал:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 6636
«Вот вам телеграмма

#TITLE: 6638
«Приезжайте, доктор,

В Африку скорей

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 6640
И спасите, доктор,

#TITLE: 6641
Наших малышей!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 6642
«Что такое? Неужели

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 6643
Ваши дети заболели?»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 6644
«Да-да-да! У них ангина,

Скарлатина, холерина,

#TITLE: 6646
Дифтерит, аппендицит,

Малярия и бронхит!

#TITLE: 6648
Приходите же скорее,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 6649
Добрый доктор Айболит!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 6650
«Ладно, ладно, побегу,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 6651
Вашим детям помогу.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 6652
Только где же вы живёте?

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 6653
На горе или в болоте?»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 6654
«Мы живём на Занзибаре,

Добрый доктор Айболит!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 6802
Он под деревом сидит.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 6803
Приходи к нему лечиться

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 6804
И корова, и волчица,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 6805
И жучок, и червячок,

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 6806
И медведица!

Всех излечит, исцелит

Добрый доктор Айболит!

И пришла к Айболиту лиса:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 6810
«Ой, меня укусила оса!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 6811
И пришёл к Айболиту барбос:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 6812
«Меня курица клюнула в нос!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 6813
И прибежала зайчиха

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 6814
И закричала: «Ай, ай!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 6815
Мой зайчик попал под трамвай!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 6816
Мой зайчик, мой мальчик

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 6817
Попал под трамвай!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 6818
Он бежал по дорожке,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 6819
И ему перерезало ножки,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 6820
И теперь он больной и хромой,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 6821
Маленький заинька мой!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 6822
И сказал Айболит: «Не беда!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 6823
Подавай-ка его сюда!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 6824
Я пришью ему новые ножки,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 6825
Он опять побежит по дорожке».

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 6826
И принесли к нему зайку,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 6827
Такого больного, хромого,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 6828
И доктор пришил ему ножки,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 6829
И заинька прыгает снова.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 6830
А с ним и зайчиха-мать

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 6831
Тоже пошла танцевать,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 6832
И смеётся она и кричит:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 6833
«Ну, спасибо тебе. Айболит!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 6834
Вдруг откуда-то шакал

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 6835
На кобыле прискакал:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 6836
«Вот вам телеграмма

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 6837
От Гиппопотама!»

«Приезжайте, доктор,

И спасите, доктор,

Наших малышей!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 6842
«Что такое? Неужели

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 6843
Ваши дети заболели?»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 6844
«Да-да-да! У них ангина,

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 6845
Скарлатина, холерина,

--- PAGE START ---

Дифтерит, аппендицит,

#TITLE: 6847
Малярия и бронхит!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 6848
Приходите же скорее,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 6849
Добрый доктор Айболит!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 6850
«Ладно, ладно, побегу,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 6851
Вашим детям помогу.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 6852
Только где же вы живёте?

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 6853
На горе или в болоте?»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 6854
«Мы живём на Занзибаре,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 6855
В Калахари и Сахаре,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 6856
На горе Фернандо-По,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 6857
Где гуляет Гиппо-по

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 6858
По широкой Лимпопо».

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 6859
И встал Айболит, побежал Айболит.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 6860
По полям, по лесам, по лугам он бежит.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 6861
И одно только слово твердит Айболит:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 6862
«Лимпопо, Лимпопо, Лимпопо!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 6863
А в лицо ему ветер, и снег, и град:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 6864
«Эй, Айболит, воротися назад!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 6865
И упал Айболит и лежит на снегу:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 6866
«Я дальше идти не могу».

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 6867
И сейчас же к нему из-за ёлки

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 6868
Выбегают мохнатые волки:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 6869
«Садись, Айболит, верхом,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 6870
Мы живо тебя довезём!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 6871
И вперёд поскакал Айболит

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 6872
И одно только слово твердит:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 6873
«Лимпопо, Лимпопо, Лимпопо!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 6874
Но вот перед ними море —

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 6875
Бушует, шумит на просторе.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 6876
А в море высокая ходит волна.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 6877
Сейчас Айболита проглотит она.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 6878
«О, если я утону,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 6879
Если пойду я ко дну,

Но вот перед ними море —

Бушует, шумит на просторе.

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 7076
А в море высокая ходит волна.

«О, если я утону,

Добрый доктор Айболит!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 7202
Он под деревом сидит.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 7203
Приходи к нему лечиться

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 7204
И корова, и волчица,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 7205
И жучок, и червячок,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 7206
И медведица!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 7207
Всех излечит, исцелит

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 7208
Добрый доктор Айболит!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 7209
И пришла к Айболиту лиса:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 7210
«Ой, меня укусила оса!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 7211
И пришёл к Айболиту барбос:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 7212
«Меня курица клюнула в нос!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 7213
И прибежала зайчиха

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 7214
И закричала: «Ай, ай!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 7215
Мой зайчик попал под трамвай!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 7216
Мой зайчик, мой мальчик

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 7217
Попал под трамвай!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 7218
Он бежал по дорожке,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 7219
И ему перерезало ножки,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 7220
И теперь он больной и хромой,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 7221
Маленький заинька мой!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 7222
И сказал Айболит: «Не беда!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 7223
Подавай-ка его сюда!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 7224
Я пришью ему новые ножки,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 7225
Он опять побежит по дорожке».

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 7226
И принесли к нему зайку,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 7227
Такого больного, хромого,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 7228
И доктор пришил ему ножки,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 7229
И заинька прыгает снова.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 7230
А с ним и зайчиха-мать

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 7231
Тоже пошла танцевать,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 7232
И смеётся она и кричит:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 7233
«Ну, спасибо тебе. Айболит!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 7234
Вдруг откуда-то шакал

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 7235
На кобыле прискакал:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 7236
«Вот вам телеграмма

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 7237
От Гиппопотама!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 7238
«Приезжайте, доктор,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 7239
В Африку скорей

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 7240
И спасите, доктор,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 7241
Наших малышей!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 7242
«Что такое? Неужели

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 7243
Ваши дети заболели?»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 7244
«Да-да-да! У них ангина,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 7245
Скарлатина, холерина,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 7246
Дифтерит, аппендицит,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 7247
Малярия и бронхит!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 7248
Приходите же скорее,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 7249
Добрый доктор Айболит!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 7250
«Ладно, ладно, побегу,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 7251
Вашим детям помогу.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 7252
Только где же вы живёте?

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 7253
На горе или в болоте?»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 7254
«Мы живём на Занзибаре,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 7255
В Калахари и Сахаре,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 7256
На горе Фернандо-По,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 7257
Где гуляет Гиппо-по

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 7258
По широкой Лимпопо».

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 7259
И встал Айболит, побежал Айболит.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 7260
По полям, по лесам, по лугам он бежит.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 7261
И одно только слово твердит Айболит:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 7262
«Лимпопо, Лимпопо, Лимпопо!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 7263
А в лицо ему ветер, и снег, и град:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 7264
«Эй, Айболит, воротися назад!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 7265
И упал Айболит и лежит на снегу:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 7266
«Я дальше идти не могу».

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 7267
И сейчас же к нему из-за ёлки

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 7268
Выбегают мохнатые волки:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 7269
«Садись, Айболит, верхом,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 7270
Мы живо тебя довезём!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 7271
И вперёд поскакал Айболит

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 7272
И одно только слово твердит:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 7273
«Лимпопо, Лимпопо, Лимпопо!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 7274
Но вот перед ними море —

Добрый доктор Айболит!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 7402
Он под деревом сидит.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 7403
Приходи к нему лечиться

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 7404
И корова, и волчица,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 7405
И жучок, и червячок,

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 7406
И медведица!

#TITLE: 7407
Всех излечит, исцелит

#TITLE: 7408
Добрый доктор Айболит!

#TITLE: 7409
И пришла к Айболиту лиса:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 7410
«Ой, меня укусила оса!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 7411
И пришёл к Айболиту барбос:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 7412
«Меня курица клюнула в нос!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 7413
И прибежала зайчиха

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 7414
И закричала: «Ай, ай!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 7415
Мой зайчик попал под трамвай!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 7416
Мой зайчик, мой мальчик

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 7417
Попал под трамвай!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 7418
Он бежал по дорожке,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 7419
И ему перерезало ножки,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 7420
И теперь он больной и хромой,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 7421
Маленький заинька мой!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 7422
И сказал Айболит: «Не беда!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 7423
Подавай-ка его сюда!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 7424
Я пришью ему новые ножки,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 7425
Он опять побежит по дорожке».

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 7426
И принесли к нему зайку,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 7427
Такого больного, хромого,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 7428
И доктор пришил ему ножки,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 7429
И заинька прыгает снова.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 7430
А с ним и зайчиха-мать

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 7431
Тоже пошла танцевать,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 7432
И смеётся она и кричит:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 7433
«Ну, спасибо тебе. Айболит!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 7434
Вдруг откуда-то шакал

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 7435
На кобыле прискакал:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 7436
«Вот вам телеграмма

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 7437
От Гиппопотама!»

--- PAGE END ---

#TITLE: 7438
«Приезжайте, доктор,

В Африку скорей

И спасите, доктор,

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 7441
Наших малышей!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 7442
«Что такое? Неужели

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 7443
Ваши дети заболели?»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 7444
«Да-да-да! У них ангина,

Скарлатина, холерина,

Дифтерит, аппендицит,

Малярия и бронхит!

Приходите же скорее,

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 7449
Добрый доктор Айболит!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 7450
«Ладно, ладно, побегу,

--- PAGE START ---

Вашим детям помогу.

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 7452
Только где же вы живёте?

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---

На горе или в болоте?»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 7454
«Мы живём на Занзибаре,

В Калахари и Сахаре,

#TITLE: 7456
На горе Фернандо-По,

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 7457
Где гуляет Гиппо-по

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 7458
По широкой Лимпопо».

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 7459
И встал Айболит, побежал Айболит.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 7460
По полям, по лесам, по лугам он бежит.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 7461
И одно только слово твердит Айболит:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 7462
«Лимпопо, Лимпопо, Лимпопо!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 7463
А в лицо ему ветер, и снег, и град:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 7464
«Эй, Айболит, воротися назад!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 7465
И упал Айболит и лежит на снегу:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 7466
«Я дальше идти не могу».

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 7467
И сейчас же к нему из-за ёлки

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 7468
Выбегают мохнатые волки:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 7469
«Садись, Айболит, верхом,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 7470
Мы живо тебя довезём!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 7471
И вперёд поскакал Айболит

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 7472
И одно только слово твердит:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 7473
«Лимпопо, Лимпопо, Лимпопо!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 7474
Но вот перед ними море —

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 7475
Бушует, шумит на просторе.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 7476
А в море высокая ходит волна.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 7477
Сейчас Айболита проглотит она.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 7478
«О, если я утону,

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 7479
Если пойду я ко дну,

«Садись на меня, Айболит,

И, как большой пароход,

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 7485
Тебя повезу я вперёд!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 7486
И сел на кита Айболит

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 7487
И одно только слово твердит:

Добрый доктор Айболит!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 7802
Он под деревом сидит.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 7803
Приходи к нему лечиться

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 7804
И корова, и волчица,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 7805
И жучок, и червячок,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 7806
И медведица!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 7807
Всех излечит, исцелит

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 7808
Добрый доктор Айболит!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 7809
И пришла к Айболиту лиса:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 7810
«Ой, меня укусила оса!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 7811
И пришёл к Айболиту барбос:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 7812
«Меня курица клюнула в нос!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 7813
И прибежала зайчиха

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 7814
И закричала: «Ай, ай!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 7815
Мой зайчик попал под трамвай!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 7816
Мой зайчик, мой мальчик

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 7817
Попал под трамвай!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 7818
Он бежал по дорожке,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 7819
И ему перерезало ножки,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 7820
И теперь он больной и хромой,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 7821
Маленький заинька мой!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 7822
И сказал Айболит: «Не беда!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 7823
Подавай-ка его сюда!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 7824
Я пришью ему новые ножки,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 7825
Он опять побежит по дорожке».

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 7826
И принесли к нему зайку,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 7827
Такого больного, хромого,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 7828
И доктор пришил ему ножки,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 7829
И заинька прыгает снова.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 7830
А с ним и зайчиха-мать

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 7831
Тоже пошла танцевать,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 7832
И смеётся она и кричит:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 7833
«Ну, спасибо тебе. Айболит!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 7834
Вдруг откуда-то шакал

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 7835
На кобыле прискакал:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 7836
«Вот вам телеграмма

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 7837
От Гиппопотама!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 7838
«Приезжайте, доктор,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 7839
В Африку скорей

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 7840
И спасите, доктор,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 7841
Наших малышей!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 7842
«Что такое? Неужели

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 7843
Ваши дети заболели?»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 7844
«Да-да-да! У них ангина,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 7845
Скарлатина, холерина,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 7846
Дифтерит, аппендицит,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 7847
Малярия и бронхит!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 7848
Приходите же скорее,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 7849
Добрый доктор Айболит!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 7850
«Ладно, ладно, побегу,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 7851
Вашим детям помогу.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 7852
Только где же вы живёте?

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 7853
На горе или в болоте?»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 7854
«Мы живём на Занзибаре,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 7855
В Калахари и Сахаре,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 7856
На горе Фернандо-По,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 7857
Где гуляет Гиппо-по

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 7858
По широкой Лимпопо».

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 7859
И встал Айболит, побежал Айболит.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 7860
По полям, по лесам, по лугам он бежит.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 7861
И одно только слово твердит Айболит:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 7862
«Лимпопо, Лимпопо, Лимпопо!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 7863
А в лицо ему ветер, и снег, и град:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 7864
«Эй, Айболит, воротися назад!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 7865
И упал Айболит и лежит на снегу:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 7866
«Я дальше идти не могу».

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 7867
И сейчас же к нему из-за ёлки

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 7868
Выбегают мохнатые волки:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 7869
«Садись, Айболит, верхом,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 7870
Мы живо тебя довезём!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 7871
И вперёд поскакал Айболит

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 7872
И одно только слово твердит:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 7873
«Лимпопо, Лимпопо, Лимпопо!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 7874
Но вот перед ними море —

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 7875
Бушует, шумит на просторе.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 7876
А в море высокая ходит волна.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 7877
Сейчас Айболита проглотит она.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 7878
«О, если я утону,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 7879
Если пойду я ко дну,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 7880
Что станется с ними, с больными,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 7881
С моими зверями лесными?»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 7882
Но тут выплывает кит:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 7883
«Садись на меня, Айболит,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 7884
И, как большой пароход,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 7885
Тебя повезу я вперёд!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 7886
И сел на кита Айболит

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 7887
И одно только слово твердит:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 7888
«Лимпопо, Лимпопо, Лимпопо!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 7889
И горы встают перед ним на пути,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 7890
И он по горам начинает ползти,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 7891
А горы всё выше, а горы всё круче,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 7892
А горы уходят под самые тучи!

Добрый доктор Айболит!

«Меня курица клюнула в нос!»

Маленький заинька мой!»

#TITLE: 8022
И сказал Айболит: «Не беда!

Подавай-ка его сюда!

А с ним и зайчиха-мать

#TITLE: 8031
Тоже пошла танцевать,

Вдруг откуда-то шакал

И одно только слово твердит Айболит:

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 8062
«Лимпопо, Лимпопо, Лимпопо!»

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 8063
А в лицо ему ветер, и снег, и град:

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 8064
«Эй, Айболит, воротися назад!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 8065
И упал Айболит и лежит на снегу:

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 8066
«Я дальше идти не могу».

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 8067
И сейчас же к нему из-за ёлки

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 8068
Выбегают мохнатые волки:

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 8069
«Садись, Айболит, верхом,

#TITLE: 8070
Мы живо тебя довезём!»

#TITLE: 8071
И вперёд поскакал Айболит

И одно только слово твердит:

#TITLE: 8073
«Лимпопо, Лимпопо, Лимпопо!»

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 8074
Но вот перед ними море —

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 8075
Бушует, шумит на просторе.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 8076
А в море высокая ходит волна.

Сейчас Айболита проглотит она.

#TITLE: 8078
«О, если я утону,

И он по горам начинает ползти,

#TITLE: 8091
А горы всё выше, а горы всё круче,

#TITLE: 8092
А горы уходят под самые тучи!

Добрый доктор Айболит!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 8402
Он под деревом сидит.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 8403
Приходи к нему лечиться

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 8404
И корова, и волчица,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 8405
И жучок, и червячок,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 8406
И медведица!

Всех излечит, исцелит

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 8408
Добрый доктор Айболит!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 8409
И пришла к Айболиту лиса:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 8410
«Ой, меня укусила оса!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 8411
И пришёл к Айболиту барбос:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 8412
«Меня курица клюнула в нос!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 8413
И прибежала зайчиха

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 8414
И закричала: «Ай, ай!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 8415
Мой зайчик попал под трамвай!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 8416
Мой зайчик, мой мальчик

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 8417
Попал под трамвай!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 8418
Он бежал по дорожке,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 8419
И ему перерезало ножки,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 8420
И теперь он больной и хромой,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 8421
Маленький заинька мой!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 8422
И сказал Айболит: «Не беда!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 8423
Подавай-ка его сюда!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 8424
Я пришью ему новые ножки,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 8425
Он опять побежит по дорожке».

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 8426
И принесли к нему зайку,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 8427
Такого больного, хромого,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 8428
И доктор пришил ему ножки,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 8429
И заинька прыгает снова.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 8430
А с ним и зайчиха-мать

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 8431
Тоже пошла танцевать,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 8432
И смеётся она и кричит:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 8433
«Ну, спасибо тебе. Айболит!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 8434
Вдруг откуда-то шакал

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 8435
На кобыле прискакал:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 8436
«Вот вам телеграмма

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 8437
От Гиппопотама!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 8438
«Приезжайте, доктор,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 8439
В Африку скорей

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 8440
И спасите, доктор,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 8441
Наших малышей!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 8442
«Что такое? Неужели

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 8443
Ваши дети заболели?»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 8444
«Да-да-да! У них ангина,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 8445
Скарлатина, холерина,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 8446
Дифтерит, аппендицит,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 8447
Малярия и бронхит!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 8448
Приходите же скорее,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 8449
Добрый доктор Айболит!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 8450
«Ладно, ладно, побегу,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 8451
Вашим детям помогу.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 8452
Только где же вы живёте?

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 8453
На горе или в болоте?»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 8454
«Мы живём на Занзибаре,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 8455
В Калахари и Сахаре,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 8456
На горе Фернандо-По,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 8457
Где гуляет Гиппо-по

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 8458
По широкой Лимпопо».

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 8459
И встал Айболит, побежал Айболит.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 8460
По полям, по лесам, по лугам он бежит.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 8461
И одно только слово твердит Айболит:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 8462
«Лимпопо, Лимпопо, Лимпопо!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 8463
А в лицо ему ветер, и снег, и град:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 8464
«Эй, Айболит, воротися назад!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 8465
И упал Айболит и лежит на снегу:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 8466
«Я дальше идти не могу».

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 8467
И сейчас же к нему из-за ёлки

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 8468
Выбегают мохнатые волки:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 8469
«Садись, Айболит, верхом,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 8470
Мы живо тебя довезём!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 8471
И вперёд поскакал Айболит

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 8472
И одно только слово твердит:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 8473
«Лимпопо, Лимпопо, Лимпопо!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 8474
Но вот перед ними море —

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 8475
Бушует, шумит на просторе.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 8476
А в море высокая ходит волна.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 8477
Сейчас Айболита проглотит она.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 8478
«О, если я утону,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 8479
Если пойду я ко дну,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 8480
Что станется с ними, с больными,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 8481
С моими зверями лесными?»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 8482
Но тут выплывает кит:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 8483
«Садись на меня, Айболит,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 8484
И, как большой пароход,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 8485
Тебя повезу я вперёд!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 8486
И сел на кита Айболит

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 8487
И одно только слово твердит:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 8488
«Лимпопо, Лимпопо, Лимпопо!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 8489
И горы встают перед ним на пути,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 8490
И он по горам начинает ползти,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 8491
А горы всё выше, а горы всё круче,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 8492
А горы уходят под самые тучи!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 8493
«О, если я не дойду,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 8495
Что станется с ними, с больными,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 8496
С моими зверями лесными?»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 8497
И сейчас же с высокой скалы

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 8498
К Айболиту слетели орлы:

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 8664
«Эй, Айболит, воротися назад!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 8665
И упал Айболит и лежит на снегу:

«Я дальше идти не могу».

#TITLE: 8667
И сейчас же к нему из-за ёлки

#TITLE: 8668
Выбегают мохнатые волки:

«Садись, Айболит, верхом,

Но вот перед ними море —

Бушует, шумит на просторе.

#TITLE: 8676
А в море высокая ходит волна.

Сейчас Айболита проглотит она.

«О, если я утону,

А горы всё выше, а горы всё круче,

#TITLE: 8692
А горы уходят под самые тучи!

«О, если я не дойду,

Добрый доктор Айболит!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 9002
Он под деревом сидит.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 9003
Приходи к нему лечиться

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 9004
И корова, и волчица,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 9005
И жучок, и червячок,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 9006
И медведица!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 9007
Всех излечит, исцелит

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 9008
Добрый доктор Айболит!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 9009
И пришла к Айболиту лиса:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 9010
«Ой, меня укусила оса!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 9011
И пришёл к Айболиту барбос:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 9012
«Меня курица клюнула в нос!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 9013
И прибежала зайчиха

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 9014
И закричала: «Ай, ай!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 9015
Мой зайчик попал под трамвай!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 9016
Мой зайчик, мой мальчик

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 9017
Попал под трамвай!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 9018
Он бежал по дорожке,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 9019
И ему перерезало ножки,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 9020
И теперь он больной и хромой,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 9021
Маленький заинька мой!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 9022
И сказал Айболит: «Не беда!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 9023
Подавай-ка его сюда!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 9024
Я пришью ему новые ножки,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 9025
Он опять побежит по дорожке».

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 9026
И принесли к нему зайку,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 9027
Такого больного, хромого,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 9028
И доктор пришил ему ножки,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 9029
И заинька прыгает снова.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 9030
А с ним и зайчиха-мать

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 9031
Тоже пошла танцевать,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 9032
И смеётся она и кричит:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 9033
«Ну, спасибо тебе. Айболит!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 9034
Вдруг откуда-то шакал

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 9035
На кобыле прискакал:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 9036
«Вот вам телеграмма

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 9037
От Гиппопотама!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 9038
«Приезжайте, доктор,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 9039
В Африку скорей

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 9040
И спасите, доктор,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 9041
Наших малышей!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 9042
«Что такое? Неужели

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 9043
Ваши дети заболели?»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 9044
«Да-да-да! У них ангина,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 9045
Скарлатина, холерина,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 9046
Дифтерит, аппендицит,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 9047
Малярия и бронхит!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 9048
Приходите же скорее,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 9049
Добрый доктор Айболит!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 9050
«Ладно, ладно, побегу,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 9051
Вашим детям помогу.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 9052
Только где же вы живёте?

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 9053
На горе или в болоте?»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 9054
«Мы живём на Занзибаре,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 9055
В Калахари и Сахаре,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 9056
На горе Фернандо-По,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 9057
Где гуляет Гиппо-по

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 9058
По широкой Лимпопо».

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 9059
И встал Айболит, побежал Айболит.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 9060
По полям, по лесам, по лугам он бежит.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 9061
И одно только слово твердит Айболит:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 9062
«Лимпопо, Лимпопо, Лимпопо!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 9063
А в лицо ему ветер, и снег, и град:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 9064
«Эй, Айболит, воротися назад!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 9065
И упал Айболит и лежит на снегу:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 9066
«Я дальше идти не могу».

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 9067
И сейчас же к нему из-за ёлки

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 9068
Выбегают мохнатые волки:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 9069
«Садись, Айболит, верхом,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 9070
Мы живо тебя довезём!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 9071
И вперёд поскакал Айболит

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 9072
И одно только слово твердит:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 9073
«Лимпопо, Лимпопо, Лимпопо!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 9074
Но вот перед ними море —

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 9075
Бушует, шумит на просторе.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 9076
А в море высокая ходит волна.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 9077
Сейчас Айболита проглотит она.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 9078
«О, если я утону,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 9079
Если пойду я ко дну,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 9080
Что станется с ними, с больными,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 9081
С моими зверями лесными?»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 9082
Но тут выплывает кит:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 9083
«Садись на меня, Айболит,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 9084
И, как большой пароход,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 9085
Тебя повезу я вперёд!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 9086
И сел на кита Айболит

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 9087
И одно только слово твердит:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 9088
«Лимпопо, Лимпопо, Лимпопо!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 9089
И горы встают перед ним на пути,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 9090
И он по горам начинает ползти,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 9091
А горы всё выше, а горы всё круче,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 9092

«Лимпопо, Лимпопо, Лимпопо!»

И принесли к нему зайку,

Такого больного, хромого,

И доктор пришил ему ножки,

Вдруг откуда-то шакал

Где гуляет Гиппо-по

По широкой Лимпопо».

#TITLE: 9259
И встал Айболит, побежал Айболит.

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 9260
По полям, по лесам, по лугам он бежит.

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 9261
И одно только слово твердит Айболит:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 9262
«Лимпопо, Лимпопо, Лимпопо!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 9263
А в лицо ему ветер, и снег, и град:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 9264
«Эй, Айболит, воротися назад!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 9265
И упал Айболит и лежит на снегу:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 9266
«Я дальше идти не могу».

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 9267
И сейчас же к нему из-за ёлки

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 9268
Выбегают мохнатые волки:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 9269
«Садись, Айболит, верхом,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 9270
Мы живо тебя довезём!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 9271
И вперёд поскакал Айболит

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 9272
И одно только слово твердит:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 9273
«Лимпопо, Лимпопо, Лимпопо!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 9274
Но вот перед ними море —

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 9275
Бушует, шумит на просторе.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 9276
А в море высокая ходит волна.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 9277
Сейчас Айболита проглотит она.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 9278
«О, если я утону,

#TITLE: 9283
«Садись на меня, Айболит,

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 9284
И, как большой пароход,

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 9285
Тебя повезу я вперёд!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 9286
И сел на кита Айболит

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 9287
И одно только слово твердит:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 9288
«Лимпопо, Лимпопо, Лимпопо!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 9289
И горы встают перед ним на пути,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 9290
И он по горам начинает ползти,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 9291
А горы всё выше, а горы всё круче,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 9292
А горы уходят под самые тучи!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 9293
«О, если я не дойду,

Если в пути пропаду,

#TITLE: 9295
Что станется с ними, с больными,

С моими зверями лесными?»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 9297
И сейчас же с высокой скалы

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 9298
К Айболиту слетели орлы:

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 9299
«Садись, Айболит, верхом,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 9300
Мы живо тебя довезём!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 9301
И сел на орла Айболит

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 9302
И одно только слово твердит:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 9303
«Лимпопо, Лимпопо, Лимпопо!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 9304
А в Африке,
А в Африке,

На чёрной
Лимпопо,

Но тут выплывает кит:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 9483
«Садись на меня, Айболит,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 9484
И, как большой пароход,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 9485
Тебя повезу я вперёд!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 9486
И сел на кита Айболит

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 9487
И одно только слово твердит:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 9488
«Лимпопо, Лимпопо, Лимпопо!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 9489
И горы встают перед ним на пути,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 9490
И он по горам начинает ползти,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 9491
А горы всё выше, а горы всё круче,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 9492
А горы уходят под самые тучи!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 9493
«О, если я не дойду,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 9494
Если в пути пропаду,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 9495
Что станется с ними, с больными,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 9496
С моими зверями лесными?»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 9497
И сейчас же с высокой скалы

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 9498
К Айболиту слетели орлы:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 9499
«Садись, Айболит, верхом,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 9500
Мы живо тебя довезём!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 9501
И сел на орла Айболит

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 9502
И одно только слово твердит:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 9503
«Лимпопо, Лимпопо, Лимпопо!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 9504
А в Африке,
А в Африке,


--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 9505
На чёрной
Лимпопо,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 9506
Сидит и плачет
В Африке

Печальный Гиппопо.

Добрый доктор Айболит!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 9602
Он под деревом сидит.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 9603
Приходи к нему лечиться

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 9604
И корова, и волчица,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 9605
И жучок, и червячок,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 9606
И медведица!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 9607
Всех излечит, исцелит

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 9608
Добрый доктор Айболит!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 9609
И пришла к Айболиту лиса:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 9610
«Ой, меня укусила оса!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 9611
И пришёл к Айболиту барбос:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 9612
«Меня курица клюнула в нос!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 9613
И прибежала зайчиха

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 9614
И закричала: «Ай, ай!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 9615
Мой зайчик попал под трамвай!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 9616
Мой зайчик, мой мальчик

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 9617
Попал под трамвай!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 9618
Он бежал по дорожке,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 9619
И ему перерезало ножки,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 9620
И теперь он больной и хромой,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 9621
Маленький заинька мой!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 9622
И сказал Айболит: «Не беда!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 9623
Подавай-ка его сюда!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 9624
Я пришью ему новые ножки,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 9625
Он опять побежит по дорожке».

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 9626
И принесли к нему зайку,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 9627
Такого больного, хромого,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 9628
И доктор пришил ему ножки,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 9629
И заинька прыгает снова.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 9630
А с ним и зайчиха-мать

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 9631
Тоже пошла танцевать,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 9632
И смеётся она и кричит:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 9633
«Ну, спасибо тебе. Айболит!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 9634
Вдруг откуда-то шакал

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 9635
На кобыле прискакал:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 9636
«Вот вам телеграмма

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 9637
От Гиппопотама!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 9638
«Приезжайте, доктор,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 9639
В Африку скорей

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 9640
И спасите, доктор,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 9641
Наших малышей!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 9642
«Что такое? Неужели

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 9643
Ваши дети заболели?»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 9644
«Да-да-да! У них ангина,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 9645
Скарлатина, холерина,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 9646
Дифтерит, аппендицит,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 9647
Малярия и бронхит!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 9648
Приходите же скорее,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 9649
Добрый доктор Айболит!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 9650
«Ладно, ладно, побегу,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 9651
Вашим детям помогу.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 9652
Только где же вы живёте?

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 9653
На горе или в болоте?»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 9654
«Мы живём на Занзибаре,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 9655
В Калахари и Сахаре,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 9656
На горе Фернандо-По,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 9657
Где гуляет Гиппо-по

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 9658
По широкой Лимпопо».

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 9659
И встал Айболит, побежал Айболит.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 9660
По полям, по лесам, по лугам он бежит.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 9661
И одно только слово твердит Айболит:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 9662
«Лимпопо, Лимпопо, Лимпопо!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 9663
А в лицо ему ветер, и снег, и град:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 9664
«Эй, Айболит, воротися назад!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 9665
И упал Айболит и лежит на снегу:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 9666
«Я дальше идти не могу».

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 9667
И сейчас же к нему из-за ёлки

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 9668
Выбегают мохнатые волки:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 9669
«Садись, Айболит, верхом,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 9670
Мы живо тебя довезём!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 9671
И вперёд поскакал Айболит

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 9672
И одно только слово твердит:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 9673
«Лимпопо, Лимпопо, Лимпопо!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 9674
Но вот перед ними море —

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 9675
Бушует, шумит на просторе.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 9676
А в море высокая ходит волна.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 9677
Сейчас Айболита проглотит она.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 9678
«О, если я утону,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 9679
Если пойду я ко дну,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 9680
Что станется с ними, с больными,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 9681
С моими зверями лесными?»

--- PAGE END ---

Но тут выплывает кит:

Добрый доктор Айболит!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 9802
Он под деревом сидит.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 9803
Приходи к нему лечиться

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 9804
И корова, и волчица,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 9805
И жучок, и червячок,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 9806
И медведица!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 9807
Всех излечит, исцелит

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 9808
Добрый доктор Айболит!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 9809
И пришла к Айболиту лиса:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 9810
«Ой, меня укусила оса!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 9811
И пришёл к Айболиту барбос:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 9812
«Меня курица клюнула в нос!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 9813
И прибежала зайчиха

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 9814
И закричала: «Ай, ай!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 9815
Мой зайчик попал под трамвай!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 9816
Мой зайчик, мой мальчик

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 9817
Попал под трамвай!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 9818
Он бежал по дорожке,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 9819
И ему перерезало ножки,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 9820
И теперь он больной и хромой,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 9821
Маленький заинька мой!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 9822
И сказал Айболит: «Не беда!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 9823
Подавай-ка его сюда!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 9824
Я пришью ему новые ножки,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 9825
Он опять побежит по дорожке».

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 9826
И принесли к нему зайку,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 9827
Такого больного, хромого,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 9828
И доктор пришил ему ножки,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 9829
И заинька прыгает снова.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 9830
А с ним и зайчиха-мать

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 9831
Тоже пошла танцевать,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 9832
И смеётся она и кричит:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 9833
«Ну, спасибо тебе. Айболит!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 9834
Вдруг откуда-то шакал

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 9835
На кобыле прискакал:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 9836
«Вот вам телеграмма

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 9837
От Гиппопотама!»

«Приезжайте, доктор,

Наших малышей!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 9842
«Что такое? Неужели

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 9843
Ваши дети заболели?»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 9844
«Да-да-да! У них ангина,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 9845
Скарлатина, холерина,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 9846
Дифтерит, аппендицит,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 9847
Малярия и бронхит!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 9848
Приходите же скорее,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 9849
Добрый доктор Айболит!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 9850
«Ладно, ладно, побегу,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 9851
Вашим детям помогу.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 9852
Только где же вы живёте?

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 9853
На горе или в болоте?»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 9854
«Мы живём на Занзибаре,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 9855
В Калахари и Сахаре,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 9856
На горе Фернандо-По,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 9857
Где гуляет Гиппо-по

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 9858
По широкой Лимпопо».

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 9859
И встал Айболит, побежал Айболит.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 9860
По полям, по лесам, по лугам он бежит.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 9861
И одно только слово твердит Айболит:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 9862
«Лимпопо, Лимпопо, Лимпопо!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 9863
А в лицо ему ветер, и снег, и град:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 9864
«Эй, Айболит, воротися назад!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 9865
И упал Айболит и лежит на снегу:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 9866
«Я дальше идти не могу».

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 9867
И сейчас же к нему из-за ёлки

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 9868
Выбегают мохнатые волки:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 9869
«Садись, Айболит, верхом,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 9870
Мы живо тебя довезём!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 9871
И вперёд поскакал Айболит

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 9872
И одно только слово твердит:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 9873
«Лимпопо, Лимпопо, Лимпопо!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 9874
Но вот перед ними море —

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 9875
Бушует, шумит на просторе.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 9876
А в море высокая ходит волна.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 9877
Сейчас Айболита проглотит она.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 9878
«О, если я утону,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 9879
Если пойду я ко дну,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 9880
Что станется с ними, с больными,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 9881
С моими зверями лесными?»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 9882
Но тут выплывает кит:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 9883
«Садись на меня, Айболит,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 9884
И, как большой пароход,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 9885
Тебя повезу я вперёд!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 9886
И сел на кита Айболит

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 9887
И одно только слово твердит:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 9888
«Лимпопо, Лимпопо, Лимпопо!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 9889
И горы встают перед ним на пути,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 9890
И он по горам начинает ползти,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 9891
А горы всё выше, а горы всё круче,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 9892
А горы уходят под самые тучи!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 9893
«О, если я не дойду,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 9894
Если в пути пропаду,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 9895
Что станется с ними, с больными,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 9896
С моими зверями лесными?»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 9897
И сейчас же с высокой скалы

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 9898
К Айболиту слетели орлы:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 9899
«Садись, Айболит, верхом,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 9900
Мы живо тебя довезём!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 9901
И сел на орла Айболит

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 9902
И одно только слово твердит:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 9903
«Лимпопо, Лимпопо, Лимпопо!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 9904
А в Африке,
А в Африке,


--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 9905
На чёрной
Лимпопо,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 9906
Сидит и плачет
В Африке

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 9907
Печальный Гиппопо.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 9908
Он в Африке, он в Африке

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 9909
Под пальмою сидит

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 9910
И на море из Африки

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 9911
Без отдыха глядит:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 9912
Не едет ли в кораблике

--- PAGE END ---

Доктор Айболит?

Выбегают мохнатые волки:

«Садись, Айболит, верхом,

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 10070
Мы живо тебя довезём!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 10071
И вперёд поскакал Айболит

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 10072
И одно только слово твердит:

#TITLE: 10073
«Лимпопо, Лимпопо, Лимпопо!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 10074
Но вот перед ними море —

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 10075
Бушует, шумит на просторе.

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 10076
А в море высокая ходит волна.

«О, если я утону,

«Садись на меня, Айболит,

Добрый доктор Айболит!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 10202
Он под деревом сидит.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 10203
Приходи к нему лечиться

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 10204
И корова, и волчица,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 10205
И жучок, и червячок,

#TITLE: 10206
И медведица!

#TITLE: 10207
Всех излечит, исцелит

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 10208
Добрый доктор Айболит!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 10209
И пришла к Айболиту лиса:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 10210
«Ой, меня укусила оса!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 10211
И пришёл к Айболиту барбос:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 10212
«Меня курица клюнула в нос!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 10213
И прибежала зайчиха

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 10214
И закричала: «Ай, ай!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 10215
Мой зайчик попал под трамвай!

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 10216
Мой зайчик, мой мальчик

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 10217
Попал под трамвай!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 10218
Он бежал по дорожке,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 10219
И ему перерезало ножки,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 10220
И теперь он больной и хромой,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 10221
Маленький заинька мой!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 10222
И сказал Айболит: «Не беда!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 10223
Подавай-ка его сюда!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 10224
Я пришью ему новые ножки,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 10225
Он опять побежит по дорожке».

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 10226
И принесли к нему зайку,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 10227
Такого больного, хромого,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 10228
И доктор пришил ему ножки,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 10229
И заинька прыгает снова.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 10230
А с ним и зайчиха-мать

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 10231
Тоже пошла танцевать,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 10232
И смеётся она и кричит:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 10233
«Ну, спасибо тебе. Айболит!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 10234
Вдруг откуда-то шакал

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 10235
На кобыле прискакал:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 10236
«Вот вам телеграмма

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 10237
От Гиппопотама!»

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 10238
«Приезжайте, доктор,

В Африку скорей

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 10242
«Что такое? Неужели

Ваши дети заболели?»

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 10244
«Да-да-да! У них ангина,

Скарлатина, холерина,

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 10246
Дифтерит, аппендицит,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 10247
Малярия и бронхит!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 10248
Приходите же скорее,

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 10249
Добрый доктор Айболит!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 10250
«Ладно, ладно, побегу,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 10251
Вашим детям помогу.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 10252
Только где же вы живёте?

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 10253
На горе или в болоте?»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 10254
«Мы живём на Занзибаре,

#TITLE: 10259
И встал Айболит, побежал Айболит.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 10260
По полям, по лесам, по лугам он бежит.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 10261
И одно только слово твердит Айболит:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 10262
«Лимпопо, Лимпопо, Лимпопо!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 10263
А в лицо ему ветер, и снег, и град:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 10264
«Эй, Айболит, воротися назад!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 10265
И упал Айболит и лежит на снегу:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 10266
«Я дальше идти не могу».

#TITLE: 10267
И сейчас же к нему из-за ёлки

#TITLE: 10401
Добрый доктор Айболит!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 10402
Он под деревом сидит.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 10403
Приходи к нему лечиться

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 10404
И корова, и волчица,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 10405
И жучок, и червячок,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 10406
И медведица!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 10407
Всех излечит, исцелит

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 10408
Добрый доктор Айболит!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 10409
И пришла к Айболиту лиса:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 10410
«Ой, меня укусила оса!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 10411
И пришёл к Айболиту барбос:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 10412
«Меня курица клюнула в нос!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 10413
И прибежала зайчиха

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 10414
И закричала: «Ай, ай!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 10415
Мой зайчик попал под трамвай!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 10416
Мой зайчик, мой мальчик

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 10417
Попал под трамвай!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 10418
Он бежал по дорожке,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 10419
И ему перерезало ножки,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 10420
И теперь он больной и хромой,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 10421
Маленький заинька мой!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 10422
И сказал Айболит: «Не беда!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 10423
Подавай-ка его сюда!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 10424
Я пришью ему новые ножки,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 10425
Он опять побежит по дорожке».

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 10426
И принесли к нему зайку,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 10427
Такого больного, хромого,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 10428
И доктор пришил ему ножки,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 10429
И заинька прыгает снова.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 10430
А с ним и зайчиха-мать

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 10431
Тоже пошла танцевать,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 10432
И смеётся она и кричит:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 10433
«Ну, спасибо тебе. Айболит!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 10434
Вдруг откуда-то шакал

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 10435
На кобыле прискакал:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 10436
«Вот вам телеграмма

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 10437
От Гиппопотама!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 10438
«Приезжайте, доктор,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 10439
В Африку скорей

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 10440
И спасите, доктор,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 10441
Наших малышей!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 10442
«Что такое? Неужели

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 10443
Ваши дети заболели?»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 10444
«Да-да-да! У них ангина,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 10445
Скарлатина, холерина,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 10446
Дифтерит, аппендицит,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 10447
Малярия и бронхит!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 10448
Приходите же скорее,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 10449
Добрый доктор Айболит!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 10450
«Ладно, ладно, побегу,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 10451
Вашим детям помогу.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 10452
Только где же вы живёте?

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 10453
На горе или в болоте?»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 10454
«Мы живём на Занзибаре,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 10455
В Калахари и Сахаре,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 10456
На горе Фернандо-По,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 10457
Где гуляет Гиппо-по

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 10458
По широкой Лимпопо».

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 10459
И встал Айболит, побежал Айболит.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 10460
По полям, по лесам, по лугам он бежит.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 10461
И одно только слово твердит Айболит:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 10462
«Лимпопо, Лимпопо, Лимпопо!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 10463
А в лицо ему ветер, и снег, и град:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 10464
«Эй, Айболит, воротися назад!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 10465
И упал Айболит и лежит на снегу:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 10466
«Я дальше идти не могу».

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 10467
И сейчас же к нему из-за ёлки

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 10468
Выбегают мохнатые волки:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 10469
«Садись, Айболит, верхом,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 10470
Мы живо тебя довезём!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 10471
И вперёд поскакал Айболит

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 10472
И одно только слово твердит:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 10473
«Лимпопо, Лимпопо, Лимпопо!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 10474
Но вот перед ними море —

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 10475
Бушует, шумит на просторе.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 10476
А в море высокая ходит волна.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 10477
Сейчас Айболита проглотит она.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 10478
«О, если я утону,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 10479
Если пойду я ко дну,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 10480
Что станется с ними, с больными,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 10481
С моими зверями лесными?»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 10482
Но тут выплывает кит:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 10483
«Садись на меня, Айболит,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 10484
И, как большой пароход,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 10485
Тебя повезу я вперёд!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 10486
И сел на кита Айболит

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 10487
И одно только слово твердит:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 10488
«Лимпопо, Лимпопо, Лимпопо!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 10489
И горы встают перед ним на пути,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 10490
И он по горам начинает ползти,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 10491
А горы всё выше, а горы всё круче,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 10492
А горы уходят под самые тучи!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 10493
«О, если я не дойду,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 10494
Если в пути пропаду,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 10495
Что станется с ними, с больными,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 10496
С моими зверями лесными?»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 10497
И сейчас же с высокой скалы

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 10498
К Айболиту слетели орлы:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 10499
«Садись, Айболит, верхом,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 10500
Мы живо тебя довезём!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 10501
И сел на орла Айболит

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 10502
И одно только слово твердит:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 10503
«Лимпопо, Лимпопо, Лимпопо!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 10504
А в Африке,
А в Африке,


--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 10505
На чёрной
Лимпопо,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 10506
Сидит и плачет
В Африке

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 10507
Печальный Гиппопо.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 10508
Он в Африке, он в Африке

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 10509
Под пальмою сидит

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 10510
И на море из Африки

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 10511
Без отдыха глядит:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 10512
Не едет ли в кораблике

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 10513
Доктор Айболит?

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 10514
И рыщут по дороге

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 10515
Слоны и носороги

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 10516
И говорят сердито:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 10517
«Что ж нету Айболита?»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 10518
А рядом бегемотики

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 10519
Схватились за животики:

Вдруг откуда-то шакал

Выбегают мохнатые волки:

«Лимпопо, Лимпопо, Лимпопо!»

Под пальмою сидит

Без отдыха глядит:

Не едет ли в кораблике

Доктор Айболит?

И рыщут по дороге

Слоны и носороги

И говорят сердито:

«Что ж нету Айболита?»

А рядом бегемотики

Схватились за животики:

Он под деревом сидит.

Приходи к нему лечиться

#TITLE: 10804
И корова, и волчица,

И жучок, и червячок,

«Меня курица клюнула в нос!»

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 10813
И прибежала зайчиха

Он бежал по дорожке,

#TITLE: 10819
И ему перерезало ножки,

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 10820
И теперь он больной и хромой,

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 10821
Маленький заинька мой!»

И сказал Айболит: «Не беда!

#TITLE: 10823
Подавай-ка его сюда!

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 10824
Я пришью ему новые ножки,

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 10825
Он опять побежит по дорожке».

#TITLE: 10826
И принесли к нему зайку,

#TITLE: 10827
Такого больного, хромого,

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 10628
И доктор пришил ему ножки,

#TITLE: 10829
И заинька прыгает снова.

А с ним и зайчиха-мать

И сел на орла Айболит

--- PAGE END ---

#TITLE: 10902
И одно только слово твердит:

«Лимпопо, Лимпопо, Лимпопо!»

Лимпопо,

Сидит и плачет

Печальный Гиппопо.

Доктор Айболит?

Добрый доктор Айболит!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 11002
Он под деревом сидит.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 11003
Приходи к нему лечиться

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 11004
И корова, и волчица,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 11005
И жучок, и червячок,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 11006
И медведица!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 11007
Всех излечит, исцелит

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 11008
Добрый доктор Айболит!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 11009
И пришла к Айболиту лиса:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 11010
«Ой, меня укусила оса!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 11011
И пришёл к Айболиту барбос:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 11012
«Меня курица клюнула в нос!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 11013
И прибежала зайчиха

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 11014
И закричала: «Ай, ай!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 11015
Мой зайчик попал под трамвай!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 11016
Мой зайчик, мой мальчик

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 11017
Попал под трамвай!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 11018
Он бежал по дорожке,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 11019
И ему перерезало ножки,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 11020
И теперь он больной и хромой,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 11021
Маленький заинька мой!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 11022
И сказал Айболит: «Не беда!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 11023
Подавай-ка его сюда!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 11024
Я пришью ему новые ножки,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 11025
Он опять побежит по дорожке».

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 11026
И принесли к нему зайку,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 11027
Такого больного, хромого,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 11028
И доктор пришил ему ножки,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 11029
И заинька прыгает снова.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 11030
А с ним и зайчиха-мать

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 11031
Тоже пошла танцевать,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 11032
И смеётся она и кричит:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 11033
«Ну, спасибо тебе. Айболит!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 11034
Вдруг откуда-то шакал

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 11035
На кобыле прискакал:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 11036
«Вот вам телеграмма

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 11037
От Гиппопотама!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 11038
«Приезжайте, доктор,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 11039
В Африку скорей

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 11040
И спасите, доктор,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 11041
Наших малышей!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 11042
«Что такое? Неужели

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 11043
Ваши дети заболели?»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 11044
«Да-да-да! У них ангина,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 11045
Скарлатина, холерина,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 11046
Дифтерит, аппендицит,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 11047
Малярия и бронхит!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 11048
Приходите же скорее,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 11049
Добрый доктор Айболит!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 11050
«Ладно, ладно, побегу,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 11051
Вашим детям помогу.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 11052
Только где же вы живёте?

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 11053
На горе или в болоте?»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 11054
«Мы живём на Занзибаре,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 11055
В Калахари и Сахаре,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 11056
На горе Фернандо-По,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 11057
Где гуляет Гиппо-по

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 11058
По широкой Лимпопо».

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 11059
И встал Айболит, побежал Айболит.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 11060
По полям, по лесам, по лугам он бежит.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 11061
И одно только слово твердит Айболит:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 11062
«Лимпопо, Лимпопо, Лимпопо!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 11063
А в лицо ему ветер, и снег, и град:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 11064
«Эй, Айболит, воротися назад!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 11065
И упал Айболит и лежит на снегу:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 11066
«Я дальше идти не могу».

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 11067
И сейчас же к нему из-за ёлки

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 11068
Выбегают мохнатые волки:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 11069
«Садись, Айболит, верхом,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 11070
Мы живо тебя довезём!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 11071
И вперёд поскакал Айболит

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 11072
И одно только слово твердит:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 11073
«Лимпопо, Лимпопо, Лимпопо!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 11074
Но вот перед ними море —

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 11075
Бушует, шумит на просторе.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 11076
А в море высокая ходит волна.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 11077
Сейчас Айболита проглотит она.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 11078
«О, если я утону,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 11079
Если пойду я ко дну,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 11080
Что станется с ними, с больными,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 11081
С моими зверями лесными?»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 11082
Но тут выплывает кит:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 11083
«Садись на меня, Айболит,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 11084
И, как большой пароход,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 11085
Тебя повезу я вперёд!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 11086
И сел на кита Айболит

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 11087
И одно только слово твердит:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 11088
«Лимпопо, Лимпопо, Лимпопо!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 11089
И горы встают перед ним на пути,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 11090
И он по горам начинает ползти,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 11091
А горы всё выше, а горы всё круче,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 11092
А горы уходят под самые тучи!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 11093
«О, если я не дойду,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 11094
Если в пути пропаду,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 11095
Что станется с ними, с больными,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 11096
С моими зверями лесными?»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 11097
И сейчас же с высокой скалы

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 11098
К Айболиту слетели орлы:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 11099
«Садись, Айболит, верхом,

Добрый доктор Айболит!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 11202
Он под деревом сидит.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 11203
Приходи к нему лечиться

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 11204
И корова, и волчица,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 11205
И жучок, и червячок,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 11206
И медведица!

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 11207
Всех излечит, исцелит

Добрый доктор Айболит!

#TITLE: 11209
И пришла к Айболиту лиса:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 11210
«Ой, меня укусила оса!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 11211
И пришёл к Айболиту барбос:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 11212
«Меня курица клюнула в нос!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 11213
И прибежала зайчиха

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 11214
И закричала: «Ай, ай!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 11215
Мой зайчик попал под трамвай!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 11216
Мой зайчик, мой мальчик

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 11217
Попал под трамвай!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 11218
Он бежал по дорожке,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 11219
И ему перерезало ножки,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 11220
И теперь он больной и хромой,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 11221
Маленький заинька мой!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 11222
И сказал Айболит: «Не беда!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 11223
Подавай-ка его сюда!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 11224
Я пришью ему новые ножки,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 11225
Он опять побежит по дорожке».

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 11226
И принесли к нему зайку,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 11227
Такого больного, хромого,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 11228
И доктор пришил ему ножки,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 11229
И заинька прыгает снова.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 11230
А с ним и зайчиха-мать

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 11231
Тоже пошла танцевать,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 11232
И смеётся она и кричит:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 11233
«Ну, спасибо тебе. Айболит!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 11234
Вдруг откуда-то шакал

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 11235
На кобыле прискакал:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 11236
«Вот вам телеграмма

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 11237
От Гиппопотама!»

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 11238
«Приезжайте, доктор,

--- PAGE START ---

В Африку скорей

И спасите, доктор,

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 11241
Наших малышей!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 11242
«Что такое? Неужели

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 11243
Ваши дети заболели?»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 11244
«Да-да-да! У них ангина,

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 11245
Скарлатина, холерина,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 11246
Дифтерит, аппендицит,

--- PAGE END ---

#TITLE: 11247
Малярия и бронхит!

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 11248
Приходите же скорее,

#TITLE: 11249
Добрый доктор Айболит!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 11250
«Ладно, ладно, побегу,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 11251
Вашим детям помогу.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 11252
Только где же вы живёте?

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 11253
На горе или в болоте?»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 11254
«Мы живём на Занзибаре,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 11255
В Калахари и Сахаре,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 11256
На горе Фернандо-По,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 11257
Где гуляет Гиппо-по

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 11258
По широкой Лимпопо».

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 11259
И встал Айболит, побежал Айболит.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 11260
По полям, по лесам, по лугам он бежит.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 11261
И одно только слово твердит Айболит:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 11262
«Лимпопо, Лимпопо, Лимпопо!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 11263
А в лицо ему ветер, и снег, и град:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 11264
«Эй, Айболит, воротися назад!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 11265
И упал Айболит и лежит на снегу:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 11266
«Я дальше идти не могу».

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 11267
И сейчас же к нему из-за ёлки

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 11268
Выбегают мохнатые волки:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 11269
«Садись, Айболит, верхом,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 11270
Мы живо тебя довезём!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 11271
И вперёд поскакал Айболит

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 11272
И одно только слово твердит:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 11273
«Лимпопо, Лимпопо, Лимпопо!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 11274
Но вот перед ними море —

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 11275
Бушует, шумит на просторе.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 11276
А в море высокая ходит волна.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 11277
Сейчас Айболита проглотит она.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 11278
«О, если я утону,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 11279
Если пойду я ко дну,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 11280
Что станется с ними, с больными,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 11281
С моими зверями лесными?»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 11282
Но тут выплывает кит:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 11283
«Садись на меня, Айболит,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 11284
И, как большой пароход,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 11285
Тебя повезу я вперёд!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 11286
И сел на кита Айболит

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 11287
И одно только слово твердит:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 11288
«Лимпопо, Лимпопо, Лимпопо!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 11289
И горы встают перед ним на пути,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 11290
И он по горам начинает ползти,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 11291
А горы всё выше, а горы всё круче,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 11292
А горы уходят под самые тучи!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 11293
«О, если я не дойду,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 11294
Если в пути пропаду,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 11295
Что станется с ними, с больными,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 11296
С моими зверями лесными?»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 11297
И сейчас же с высокой скалы

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 11298
К Айболиту слетели орлы:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 11299
«Садись, Айболит, верхом,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 11300
Мы живо тебя довезём!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 11301
И сел на орла Айболит

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 11302
И одно только слово твердит:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 11303
«Лимпопо, Лимпопо, Лимпопо!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 11304
А в Африке,
А в Африке,


--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 11305
На чёрной
Лимпопо,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 11306
Сидит и плачет
В Африке

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 11307
Печальный Гиппопо.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 11308
Он в Африке, он в Африке

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 11309
Под пальмою сидит

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 11310
И на море из Африки

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 11311
Без отдыха глядит:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 11312
Не едет ли в кораблике

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 11313
Доктор Айболит?

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 11314
И рыщут по дороге

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 11315
Слоны и носороги

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 11316
И говорят сердито:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 11317
«Что ж нету Айболита?»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 11318
А рядом бегемотики

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 11319
Схватились за животики:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 11320
У них, у бегемотиков,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 11321
Животики болят.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 11322
И тут же страусята

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 11323
Визжат, как поросята.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 11324
Ах, жалко, жалко, жалко

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 11325
Бедных страусят!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 11326
И корь, и дифтерит у них,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 11327
И оспа, и бронхит у них,

По полям, по лесам, по лугам он бежит.

#TITLE: 11612
«Меня курица клюнула в нос!»

#TITLE: 11613
И прибежала зайчиха

Попал под трамвай!

Он бежал по дорожке,

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 11619
И ему перерезало ножки,

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 11620
И теперь он больной и хромой,

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 11621
Маленький заинька мой!»

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 11622
И сказал Айболит: «Не беда!

#TITLE: 11623
Подавай-ка его сюда!

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 11624
Я пришью ему новые ножки,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 11625
Он опять побежит по дорожке».

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 11626
И принесли к нему зайку,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 11627
Такого больного, хромого,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 11628
И доктор пришил ему ножки,

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 11629
И заинька прыгает снова.

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 11630
А с ним и зайчиха-мать

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 11631
Тоже пошла танцевать,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 11632
И смеётся она и кричит:

#TITLE: 11633
«Ну, спасибо тебе. Айболит!»

#TITLE: 11634

Добрый доктор Айболит!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 11802
Он под деревом сидит.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 11803
Приходи к нему лечиться

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 11804
И корова, и волчица,

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 11805
И жучок, и червячок,

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 11808
Добрый доктор Айболит!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 11809
И пришла к Айболиту лиса:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 11810
«Ой, меня укусила оса!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 11811
И пришёл к Айболиту барбос:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 11812
«Меня курица клюнула в нос!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 11813
И прибежала зайчиха

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 11814
И закричала: «Ай, ай!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 11815
Мой зайчик попал под трамвай!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 11816
Мой зайчик, мой мальчик

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 11817
Попал под трамвай!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 11818
Он бежал по дорожке,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 11819
И ему перерезало ножки,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 11820
И теперь он больной и хромой,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 11821
Маленький заинька мой!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 11822
И сказал Айболит: «Не беда!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 11823
Подавай-ка его сюда!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 11824
Я пришью ему новые ножки,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 11825
Он опять побежит по дорожке».

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 11826
И принесли к нему зайку,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 11827
Такого больного, хромого,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 11828
И доктор пришил ему ножки,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 11829
И заинька прыгает снова.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 11830
А с ним и зайчиха-мать

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 11831
Тоже пошла танцевать,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 11832
И смеётся она и кричит:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 11833
«Ну, спасибо тебе. Айболит!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 11834
Вдруг откуда-то шакал

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 11835
На кобыле прискакал:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 11836
«Вот вам телеграмма

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 11837
От Гиппопотама!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 11838
«Приезжайте, доктор,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 11839
В Африку скорей

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 11840
И спасите, доктор,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 11841
Наших малышей!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 11842
«Что такое? Неужели

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 11843
Ваши дети заболели?»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 11844
«Да-да-да! У них ангина,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 11845
Скарлатина, холерина,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 11846
Дифтерит, аппендицит,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 11847
Малярия и бронхит!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 11848
Приходите же скорее,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 11849
Добрый доктор Айболит!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 11850
«Ладно, ладно, побегу,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 11851
Вашим детям помогу.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 11852
Только где же вы живёте?

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 11853
На горе или в болоте?»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 11854
«Мы живём на Занзибаре,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 11855
В Калахари и Сахаре,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 11856
На горе Фернандо-По,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 11857
Где гуляет Гиппо-по

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 11858
По широкой Лимпопо».

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 11859
И встал Айболит, побежал Айболит.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 11860
По полям, по лесам, по лугам он бежит.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 11861
И одно только слово твердит Айболит:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 11862
«Лимпопо, Лимпопо, Лимпопо!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 11863
А в лицо ему ветер, и снег, и град:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 11864
«Эй, Айболит, воротися назад!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 11865
И упал Айболит и лежит на снегу:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 11866
«Я дальше идти не могу».

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 11867
И сейчас же к нему из-за ёлки

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 11868
Выбегают мохнатые волки:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 11869
«Садись, Айболит, верхом,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 11870
Мы живо тебя довезём!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 11871
И вперёд поскакал Айболит

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 11872
И одно только слово твердит:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 11873
«Лимпопо, Лимпопо, Лимпопо!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 11874
Но вот перед ними море —

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 11875
Бушует, шумит на просторе.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 11876
А в море высокая ходит волна.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 11877
Сейчас Айболита проглотит она.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 11878
«О, если я утону,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 11879
Если пойду я ко дну,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 11880
Что станется с ними, с больными,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 11881
С моими зверями лесными?»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 11882
Но тут выплывает кит:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 11883
«Садись на меня, Айболит,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 11884
И, как большой пароход,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 11885
Тебя повезу я вперёд!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 11886
И сел на кита Айболит

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 11887
И одно только слово твердит:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 11888
«Лимпопо, Лимпопо, Лимпопо!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 11889
И горы встают перед ним на пути,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 11890
И он по горам начинает ползти,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 11891
А горы всё выше, а горы всё круче,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 11892
А горы уходят под самые тучи!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 11893
«О, если я не дойду,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 11894
Если в пути пропаду,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 11895
Что станется с ними, с больными,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 11896
С моими зверями лесными?»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 11897
И сейчас же с высокой скалы

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 11898
К Айболиту слетели орлы:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 11899
«Садись, Айболит, верхом,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 11900
Мы живо тебя довезём!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 11901
И сел на орла Айболит

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 11902
И одно только слово твердит:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 11903
«Лимпопо, Лимпопо, Лимпопо!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 11904
А в Африке,
А в Африке,


--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 11905
На чёрной
Лимпопо,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 11906
Сидит и плачет
В Африке

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 11907
Печальный Гиппопо.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 11908
Он в Африке, он в Африке

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 11909
Под пальмою сидит

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 11910
И на море из Африки

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 11911
Без отдыха глядит:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 11912
Не едет ли в кораблике

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 11913
Доктор Айболит?

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 11914
И рыщут по дороге

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 11915
Слоны и носороги

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 11916
И говорят сердито:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 11917
«Что ж нету Айболита?»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 11918
А рядом бегемотики

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 11919
Схватились за животики:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 11920
У них, у бегемотиков,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 11921
Животики болят.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 11922
И тут же страусята

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 11923
Визжат, как поросята.

--- PAGE END ---

И голова болит у них,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 11929
И горлышко болит.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 11930
Они лежат и бредят:

«Меня курица клюнула в нос!»

И прибежала зайчиха

Мой зайчик, мой мальчик

Попал под трамвай!

#TITLE: 12018
Он бежал по дорожке,

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 12019
И ему перерезало ножки,

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 12020
И теперь он больной и хромой,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 12021
Маленький заинька мой!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 12022
И сказал Айболит: «Не беда!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 12023
Подавай-ка его сюда!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 12024
Я пришью ему новые ножки,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 12025
Он опять побежит по дорожке».

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 12026
И принесли к нему зайку,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 12027
Такого больного, хромого,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 12028
И доктор пришил ему ножки,

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 12029
И заинька прыгает снова.

#TITLE: 12030
А с ним и зайчиха-мать

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 12031
Тоже пошла танцевать,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 12032
И смеётся она и кричит:

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 12033
«Ну, спасибо тебе. Айболит!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 12034
Вдруг откуда-то шакал

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 12035
На кобыле прискакал:

«Вот вам телеграмма

В Калахари и Сахаре,

На горе Фернандо-По,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 12057
Где гуляет Гиппо-по

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 12058
По широкой Лимпопо».

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 12059
И встал Айболит, побежал Айболит.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 12060
По полям, по лесам, по лугам он бежит.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 12061
И одно только слово твердит Айболит:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 12062
«Лимпопо, Лимпопо, Лимпопо!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 12063
А в лицо ему ветер, и снег, и град:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 12064
«Эй, Айболит, воротися назад!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 12065
И упал Айболит и лежит на снегу:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 12066
«Я дальше идти не могу».

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 12067
И сейчас же к нему из-за ёлки

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 12068
Выбегают мохнатые волки:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 12069
«Садись, Айболит, верхом,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 12070
Мы живо тебя довезём!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 12071
И вперёд поскакал Айболит

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 12072
И одно только слово твердит:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 12073
«Лимпопо, Лимпопо, Лимпопо!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 12074
Но вот перед ними море —

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 12075
Бушует, шумит на просторе.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 12076
А в море высокая ходит волна.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 12077
Сейчас Айболита проглотит она.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 12078
«О, если я утону,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 12079
Если пойду я ко дну,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 12080
Что станется с ними, с больными,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 12081
С моими зверями лесными?»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 12082
Но тут выплывает кит:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 12083
«Садись на меня, Айболит,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 12084
И, как большой пароход,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 12085
Тебя повезу я вперёд!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 12086
И сел на кита Айболит

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 12087
И одно только слово твердит:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 12088
«Лимпопо, Лимпопо, Лимпопо!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 12089
И горы встают перед ним на пути,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 12090
И он по горам начинает ползти,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 12091
А горы всё выше, а горы всё круче,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 12092
А горы уходят под самые тучи!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 12093
«О, если я не дойду,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 12094
Если в пути пропаду,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 12095
Что станется с ними, с больными,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 12096
С моими зверями лесными?»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 12097
И сейчас же с высокой скалы

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 12098
К Айболиту слетели орлы:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 12099
«Садись, Айболит, верхом,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 12100
Мы живо тебя довезём!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 12101
И сел на орла Айболит

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 12102
И одно только слово твердит:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 12103
«Лимпопо, Лимпопо, Лимпопо!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 12104
А в Африке,
А в Африке,


--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 12105
На чёрной
Лимпопо,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 12106
Сидит и плачет
В Африке

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 12107
Печальный Гиппопо.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 12108
Он в Африке, он в Африке

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 12109
Под пальмою сидит

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 12110
И на море из Африки

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 12111
Без отдыха глядит:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 12112
Не едет ли в кораблике

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 12113
Доктор Айболит?

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 12114
И рыщут по дороге

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 12115
Слоны и носороги

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 12116
И говорят сердито:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 12117
«Что ж нету Айболита?»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 12118
А рядом бегемотики

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 12119
Схватились за животики:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 12120
У них, у бегемотиков,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 12121
Животики болят.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 12122
И тут же страусята

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 12123
Визжат, как поросята.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 12124
Ах, жалко, жалко, жалко

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 12125
Бедных страусят!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 12126
И корь, и дифтерит у них,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 12127
И оспа, и бронхит у них,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 12128
И голова болит у них,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 12129
И горлышко болит.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 12130
Они лежат и бредят:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 12131
«Ну что же он не едет,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 12132
Ну что же он не едет,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 12133
Доктор Айболит?»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 12134
А рядом прикорнула

Зубастая акула,

«Лимпопо, Лимпопо, Лимпопо!»

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 12274
Но вот перед ними море —

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 12275
Бушует, шумит на просторе.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 12276
А в море высокая ходит волна.

Сейчас Айболита проглотит она.

«Садись на меня, Айболит,

И, как большой пароход,

#TITLE: 12285
Тебя повезу я вперёд!»

И сел на кита Айболит

Добрый доктор Айболит!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 12402
Он под деревом сидит.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 12403
Приходи к нему лечиться

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 12404
И корова, и волчица,

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 12405
И жучок, и червячок,

И медведица!

#TITLE: 12407
Всех излечит, исцелит

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 12408
Добрый доктор Айболит!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 12409
И пришла к Айболиту лиса:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 12410
«Ой, меня укусила оса!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 12411
И пришёл к Айболиту барбос:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 12412
«Меня курица клюнула в нос!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 12413
И прибежала зайчиха

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 12414
И закричала: «Ай, ай!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 12415
Мой зайчик попал под трамвай!

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 12416
Мой зайчик, мой мальчик

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 12417
Попал под трамвай!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 12418
Он бежал по дорожке,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 12419
И ему перерезало ножки,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 12420
И теперь он больной и хромой,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 12421
Маленький заинька мой!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 12422
И сказал Айболит: «Не беда!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 12423
Подавай-ка его сюда!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 12424
Я пришью ему новые ножки,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 12425
Он опять побежит по дорожке».

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 12426
И принесли к нему зайку,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 12427
Такого больного, хромого,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 12428
И доктор пришил ему ножки,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 12429
И заинька прыгает снова.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 12430
А с ним и зайчиха-мать

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 12431
Тоже пошла танцевать,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 12432
И смеётся она и кричит:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 12433
«Ну, спасибо тебе. Айболит!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 12434
Вдруг откуда-то шакал

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 12435
На кобыле прискакал:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 12436
«Вот вам телеграмма

#TITLE: 12437
От Гиппопотама!»

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 12438
«Приезжайте, доктор,

В Африку скорей

#TITLE: 12440
И спасите, доктор,

Наших малышей!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 12442
«Что такое? Неужели

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 12443
Ваши дети заболели?»

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 12444
«Да-да-да! У них ангина,

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 12445
Скарлатина, холерина,

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 12446
Дифтерит, аппендицит,

#TITLE: 12447
Малярия и бронхит!

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 12448
Приходите же скорее,

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 12449

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 12450
«Ладно, ладно, побегу,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 12451
Вашим детям помогу.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 12452
Только где же вы живёте?

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 12453
На горе или в болоте?»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 12454
«Мы живём на Занзибаре,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 12455
В Калахари и Сахаре,

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 12456
На горе Фернандо-По,

#TITLE: 12457

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 12458
По широкой Лимпопо».

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 12459
И встал Айболит, побежал Айболит.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 12460
По полям, по лесам, по лугам он бежит.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 12461
И одно только слово твердит Айболит:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 12462
«Лимпопо, Лимпопо, Лимпопо!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 12463
А в лицо ему ветер, и снег, и град:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 12464
«Эй, Айболит, воротися назад!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 12465
И упал Айболит и лежит на снегу:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 12466
«Я дальше идти не могу».

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 12467
И сейчас же к нему из-за ёлки

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 12468
Выбегают мохнатые волки:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 12469
«Садись, Айболит, верхом,

Добрый доктор Айболит!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 12602
Он под деревом сидит.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 12603
Приходи к нему лечиться

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 12604
И корова, и волчица,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 12605
И жучок, и червячок,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 12606
И медведица!

Всех излечит, исцелит

Добрый доктор Айболит!

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 12609
И пришла к Айболиту лиса:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 12610
«Ой, меня укусила оса!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 12611
И пришёл к Айболиту барбос:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 12612
«Меня курица клюнула в нос!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 12613
И прибежала зайчиха

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 12614
И закричала: «Ай, ай!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 12615
Мой зайчик попал под трамвай!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 12616
Мой зайчик, мой мальчик

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 12617
Попал под трамвай!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 12618
Он бежал по дорожке,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 12619
И ему перерезало ножки,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 12620
И теперь он больной и хромой,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 12621
Маленький заинька мой!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 12622
И сказал Айболит: «Не беда!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 12623
Подавай-ка его сюда!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 12624
Я пришью ему новые ножки,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 12625
Он опять побежит по дорожке».

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 12626
И принесли к нему зайку,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 12627
Такого больного, хромого,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 12628
И доктор пришил ему ножки,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 12629
И заинька прыгает снова.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 12630
А с ним и зайчиха-мать

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 12631
Тоже пошла танцевать,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 12632
И смеётся она и кричит:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 12633
«Ну, спасибо тебе. Айболит!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 12634
Вдруг откуда-то шакал

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 12635
На кобыле прискакал:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 12636
«Вот вам телеграмма

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 12637
От Гиппопотама!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 12638
«Приезжайте, доктор,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 12639
В Африку скорей

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 12640
И спасите, доктор,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 12641
Наших малышей!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 12642
«Что такое? Неужели

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 12643
Ваши дети заболели?»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 12644
«Да-да-да! У них ангина,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 12645
Скарлатина, холерина,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 12646
Дифтерит, аппендицит,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 12647
Малярия и бронхит!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 12648
Приходите же скорее,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 12649
Добрый доктор Айболит!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 12650
«Ладно, ладно, побегу,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 12651
Вашим детям помогу.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 12652
Только где же вы живёте?

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 12653
На горе или в болоте?»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 12654
«Мы живём на Занзибаре,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 12655
В Калахари и Сахаре,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 12656
На горе Фернандо-По,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 12657
Где гуляет Гиппо-по

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 12658
По широкой Лимпопо».

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 12659
И встал Айболит, побежал Айболит.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 12660
По полям, по лесам, по лугам он бежит.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 12661
И одно только слово твердит Айболит:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 12662
«Лимпопо, Лимпопо, Лимпопо!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 12663
А в лицо ему ветер, и снег, и град:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 12664
«Эй, Айболит, воротися назад!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 12665
И упал Айболит и лежит на снегу:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 12666
«Я дальше идти не могу».

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 12667
И сейчас же к нему из-за ёлки

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 12668
Выбегают мохнатые волки:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 12669
«Садись, Айболит, верхом,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 12670
Мы живо тебя довезём!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 12671
И вперёд поскакал Айболит

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 12672
И одно только слово твердит:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 12673
«Лимпопо, Лимпопо, Лимпопо!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 12674
Но вот перед ними море —

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 12675
Бушует, шумит на просторе.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 12676
А в море высокая ходит волна.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 12677
Сейчас Айболита проглотит она.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 12678
«О, если я утону,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 12679
Если пойду я ко дну,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 12680
Что станется с ними, с больными,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 12681
С моими зверями лесными?»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 12682
Но тут выплывает кит:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 12683
«Садись на меня, Айболит,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 12684
И, как большой пароход,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 12685
Тебя повезу я вперёд!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 12686
И сел на кита Айболит

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 12687
И одно только слово твердит:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 12688
«Лимпопо, Лимпопо, Лимпопо!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 12689
И горы встают перед ним на пути,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 12690
И он по горам начинает ползти,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 12691
А горы всё выше, а горы всё круче,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 12692
А горы уходят под самые тучи!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 12693
«О, если я не дойду,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 12694
Если в пути пропаду,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 12695
Что станется с ними, с больными,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 12696
С моими зверями лесными?»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 12697
И сейчас же с высокой скалы

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 12698
К Айболиту слетели орлы:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 12699
«Садись, Айболит, верхом,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 12700
Мы живо тебя довезём!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 12701
И сел на орла Айболит

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 12702
И одно только слово твердит:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 12703
«Лимпопо, Лимпопо, Лимпопо!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 12704
А в Африке,
А в Африке,


--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 12705
На чёрной
Лимпопо,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 12706
Сидит и плачет
В Африке

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 12707
Печальный Гиппопо.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 12708
Он в Африке, он в Африке

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 12709
Под пальмою сидит

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 12710
И на море из Африки

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 12711
Без отдыха глядит:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 12712
Не едет ли в кораблике

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 12713
Доктор Айболит?

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 12714
И рыщут по дороге

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 12715
Слоны и носороги

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 12716
И говорят сердито:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 12717
«Что ж нету Айболита?»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 12718
А рядом бегемотики

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 12719
Схватились за животики:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 12720
У них, у бегемотиков,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 12721
Животики болят.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 12722
И тут же страусята

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 12723
Визжат, как поросята.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 12724
Ах, жалко, жалко, жалко

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 12725
Бедных страусят!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 12726
И корь, и дифтерит у них,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 12727
И оспа, и бронхит у них,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 12728
И голова болит у них,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 12729
И горлышко болит.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 12730
Они лежат и бредят:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 12731
«Ну что же он не едет,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 12732
Ну что же он не едет,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 12733
Доктор Айболит?»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 12734
А рядом прикорнула

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 12735
Зубастая акула,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 12736
Зубастая акула

--- PAGE END ---

#TITLE: 12737
На солнышке лежит.

Ах, у её малюток,

У бедных акулят,

Уже двенадцать суток

Подавай-ка его сюда!

Он опять побежит по дорожке».

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 12827
Такого больного, хромого,

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 12828
И доктор пришил ему ножки,

И заинька прыгает снова.

А с ним и зайчиха-мать

Тоже пошла танцевать,

#TITLE: 12833
«Ну, спасибо тебе. Айболит!»

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 12834
Вдруг откуда-то шакал

На кобыле прискакал:

#TITLE: 12859
И встал Айболит, побежал Айболит.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 12860
По полям, по лесам, по лугам он бежит.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 12861
И одно только слово твердит Айболит:

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 12862
«Лимпопо, Лимпопо, Лимпопо!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 12863
А в лицо ему ветер, и снег, и град:

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 12864
«Эй, Айболит, воротися назад!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 12865
И упал Айболит и лежит на снегу:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 12866
«Я дальше идти не могу».

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 12867
И сейчас же к нему из-за ёлки

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 12868
Выбегают мохнатые волки:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 12869
«Садись, Айболит, верхом,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 12870
Мы живо тебя довезём!»

#TITLE: 12873
«Лимпопо, Лимпопо, Лимпопо!»

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 12874
Но вот перед ними море —

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 12875
Бушует, шумит на просторе.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 12876
А в море высокая ходит волна.

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 12877
Сейчас Айболита проглотит она.

#TITLE: 12878
«О, если я утону,

#TITLE: 12883
«Садись на меня, Айболит,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 12884
И, как большой пароход,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 12885
Тебя повезу я вперёд!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 12886
И сел на кита Айболит

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 12887
И одно только слово твердит:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 12888
«Лимпопо, Лимпопо, Лимпопо!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 12889
И горы встают перед ним на пути,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 12890
И он по горам начинает ползти,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 12891
А горы всё выше, а горы всё круче,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 12892
А горы уходят под самые тучи!

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 12893
«О, если я не дойду,

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 12897
И сейчас же с высокой скалы

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 12898
К Айболиту слетели орлы:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 12899
«Садись, Айболит, верхом,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 12900
Мы живо тебя довезём!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 12901
И сел на орла Айболит

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 12902
И одно только слово твердит:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 12903
«Лимпопо, Лимпопо, Лимпопо!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 12904
А в Африке,
А в Африке,


--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 12905
На чёрной
Лимпопо,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 12906
Сидит и плачет
В Африке

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 12907
Печальный Гиппопо.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 12908
Он в Африке, он в Африке

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 12909
Под пальмою сидит

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 12910
И на море из Африки

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 12911
Без отдыха глядит:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 12912
Не едет ли в кораблике

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 12913
Доктор Айболит?

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 12914
И рыщут по дороге

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 12915
Слоны и носороги

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 12916
И говорят сердито:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 12917
«Что ж нету Айболита?»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 12918
А рядом бегемотики

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 12919
Схватились за животики:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 12920
У них, у бегемотиков,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 12921
Животики болят.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 12922
И тут же страусята

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 12923
Визжат, как поросята.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 12924
Ах, жалко, жалко, жалко

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 12925
Бедных страусят!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 12926
И корь, и дифтерит у них,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 12927
И оспа, и бронхит у них,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 12928
И голова болит у них,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 12929
И горлышко болит.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 12930
Они лежат и бредят:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 12931
«Ну что же он не едет,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 12932
Ну что же он не едет,

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 12933
Доктор Айболит?»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 12934
А рядом прикорнула

#TITLE: 12935
Зубастая акула,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 12936
Зубастая акула

На солнышке лежит.

Ах, у её малюток,

У бедных акулят,

Уже двенадцать суток

#TITLE: 12941
Зубки болят!

И вывихнуто плечико

У бедного кузнечика;

#TITLE: 13082
Но тут выплывает кит:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 13083
«Садись на меня, Айболит,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 13084
И, как большой пароход,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 13085
Тебя повезу я вперёд!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 13086
И сел на кита Айболит

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 13087
И одно только слово твердит:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 13088
«Лимпопо, Лимпопо, Лимпопо!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 13089
И горы встают перед ним на пути,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 13090
И он по горам начинает ползти,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 13091
А горы всё выше, а горы всё круче,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 13092
А горы уходят под самые тучи!

#TITLE: 13093
«О, если я не дойду,

Добрый доктор Айболит!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 13202
Он под деревом сидит.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 13203
Приходи к нему лечиться

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 13204
И корова, и волчица,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 13205
И жучок, и червячок,

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 13206
И медведица!

Всех излечит, исцелит

Добрый доктор Айболит!

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 13209
И пришла к Айболиту лиса:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 13210
«Ой, меня укусила оса!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 13211
И пришёл к Айболиту барбос:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 13212
«Меня курица клюнула в нос!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 13213
И прибежала зайчиха

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 13214
И закричала: «Ай, ай!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 13215
Мой зайчик попал под трамвай!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 13216
Мой зайчик, мой мальчик

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 13217
Попал под трамвай!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 13218
Он бежал по дорожке,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 13219
И ему перерезало ножки,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 13220
И теперь он больной и хромой,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 13221
Маленький заинька мой!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 13222
И сказал Айболит: «Не беда!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 13223
Подавай-ка его сюда!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 13224
Я пришью ему новые ножки,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 13225
Он опять побежит по дорожке».

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 13226
И принесли к нему зайку,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 13227
Такого больного, хромого,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 13228
И доктор пришил ему ножки,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 13229
И заинька прыгает снова.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 13230
А с ним и зайчиха-мать

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 13231
Тоже пошла танцевать,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 13232
И смеётся она и кричит:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 13233
«Ну, спасибо тебе. Айболит!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 13234
Вдруг откуда-то шакал

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 13235
На кобыле прискакал:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 13236
«Вот вам телеграмма

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 13237
От Гиппопотама!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 13238
«Приезжайте, доктор,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 13239
В Африку скорей

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 13240
И спасите, доктор,

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 13241
Наших малышей!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 13242
«Что такое? Неужели

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 13243
Ваши дети заболели?»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 13244
«Да-да-да! У них ангина,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 13245
Скарлатина, холерина,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 13246
Дифтерит, аппендицит,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 13247
Малярия и бронхит!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 13248
Приходите же скорее,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 13249
Добрый доктор Айболит!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 13250
«Ладно, ладно, побегу,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 13251
Вашим детям помогу.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 13252
Только где же вы живёте?

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 13253
На горе или в болоте?»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 13254
«Мы живём на Занзибаре,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 13255
В Калахари и Сахаре,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 13256
На горе Фернандо-По,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 13257
Где гуляет Гиппо-по

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 13258
По широкой Лимпопо».

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 13259
И встал Айболит, побежал Айболит.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 13260
По полям, по лесам, по лугам он бежит.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 13261
И одно только слово твердит Айболит:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 13262
«Лимпопо, Лимпопо, Лимпопо!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 13263
А в лицо ему ветер, и снег, и град:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 13264
«Эй, Айболит, воротися назад!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 13265
И упал Айболит и лежит на снегу:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 13266
«Я дальше идти не могу».

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 13267
И сейчас же к нему из-за ёлки

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 13268
Выбегают мохнатые волки:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 13269
«Садись, Айболит, верхом,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 13270
Мы живо тебя довезём!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 13271
И вперёд поскакал Айболит

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 13272
И одно только слово твердит:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 13273
«Лимпопо, Лимпопо, Лимпопо!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 13274
Но вот перед ними море —

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 13275
Бушует, шумит на просторе.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 13276
А в море высокая ходит волна.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 13277
Сейчас Айболита проглотит она.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 13278
«О, если я утону,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 13279
Если пойду я ко дну,

Добрый доктор Айболит!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 13402
Он под деревом сидит.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 13403
Приходи к нему лечиться

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 13404
И корова, и волчица,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 13405
И жучок, и червячок,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 13406
И медведица!

#TITLE: 13407
Всех излечит, исцелит

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 13408
Добрый доктор Айболит!

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 13409
И пришла к Айболиту лиса:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 13410
«Ой, меня укусила оса!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 13411
И пришёл к Айболиту барбос:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 13412
«Меня курица клюнула в нос!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 13413
И прибежала зайчиха

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 13414
И закричала: «Ай, ай!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 13415
Мой зайчик попал под трамвай!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 13416
Мой зайчик, мой мальчик

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 13417
Попал под трамвай!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 13418
Он бежал по дорожке,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 13419
И ему перерезало ножки,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 13420
И теперь он больной и хромой,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 13421
Маленький заинька мой!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 13422
И сказал Айболит: «Не беда!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 13423
Подавай-ка его сюда!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 13424
Я пришью ему новые ножки,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 13425
Он опять побежит по дорожке».

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 13426
И принесли к нему зайку,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 13427
Такого больного, хромого,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 13428
И доктор пришил ему ножки,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 13429
И заинька прыгает снова.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 13430
А с ним и зайчиха-мать

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 13431
Тоже пошла танцевать,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 13432
И смеётся она и кричит:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 13433
«Ну, спасибо тебе. Айболит!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 13434
Вдруг откуда-то шакал

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 13435
На кобыле прискакал:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 13436
«Вот вам телеграмма

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 13437
От Гиппопотама!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 13438
«Приезжайте, доктор,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 13439
В Африку скорей

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 13440
И спасите, доктор,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 13441
Наших малышей!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 13442
«Что такое? Неужели

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 13443
Ваши дети заболели?»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 13444
«Да-да-да! У них ангина,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 13445
Скарлатина, холерина,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 13446
Дифтерит, аппендицит,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 13447
Малярия и бронхит!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 13448
Приходите же скорее,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 13449
Добрый доктор Айболит!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 13450
«Ладно, ладно, побегу,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 13451
Вашим детям помогу.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 13452
Только где же вы живёте?

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 13453
На горе или в болоте?»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 13454
«Мы живём на Занзибаре,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 13455
В Калахари и Сахаре,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 13456
На горе Фернандо-По,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 13457
Где гуляет Гиппо-по

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 13458
По широкой Лимпопо».

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 13459
И встал Айболит, побежал Айболит.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 13460
По полям, по лесам, по лугам он бежит.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 13461
И одно только слово твердит Айболит:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 13462
«Лимпопо, Лимпопо, Лимпопо!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 13463
А в лицо ему ветер, и снег, и град:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 13464
«Эй, Айболит, воротися назад!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 13465
И упал Айболит и лежит на снегу:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 13466
«Я дальше идти не могу».

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 13467
И сейчас же к нему из-за ёлки

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 13468
Выбегают мохнатые волки:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 13469
«Садись, Айболит, верхом,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 13470
Мы живо тебя довезём!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 13471
И вперёд поскакал Айболит

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 13472
И одно только слово твердит:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 13473
«Лимпопо, Лимпопо, Лимпопо!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 13474
Но вот перед ними море —

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 13475
Бушует, шумит на просторе.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 13476
А в море высокая ходит волна.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 13477
Сейчас Айболита проглотит она.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 13478
«О, если я утону,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 13479
Если пойду я ко дну,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 13480
Что станется с ними, с больными,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 13481
С моими зверями лесными?»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 13482
Но тут выплывает кит:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 13483
«Садись на меня, Айболит,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 13484
И, как большой пароход,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 13485
Тебя повезу я вперёд!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 13486
И сел на кита Айболит

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 13487
И одно только слово твердит:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 13488
«Лимпопо, Лимпопо, Лимпопо!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 13489
И горы встают перед ним на пути,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 13490
И он по горам начинает ползти,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 13491
А горы всё выше, а горы всё круче,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 13492
А горы уходят под самые тучи!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 13493
«О, если я не дойду,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 13494
Если в пути пропаду,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 13495
Что станется с ними, с больными,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 13496
С моими зверями лесными?»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 13497
И сейчас же с высокой скалы

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 13498
К Айболиту слетели орлы:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 13499
«Садись, Айболит, верхом,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 13500
Мы живо тебя довезём!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 13501
И сел на орла Айболит

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 13502
И одно только слово твердит:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 13503
«Лимпопо, Лимпопо, Лимпопо!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 13504
А в Африке,
А в Африке,


--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 13505
На чёрной
Лимпопо,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 13506
Сидит и плачет
В Африке

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 13507
Печальный Гиппопо.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 13508
Он в Африке, он в Африке

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 13509
Под пальмою сидит

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 13510
И на море из Африки

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 13511
Без отдыха глядит:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 13512
Не едет ли в кораблике

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 13513
Доктор Айболит?

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 13514
И рыщут по дороге

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 13515
Слоны и носороги

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 13516
И говорят сердито:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 13517
«Что ж нету Айболита?»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 13518
А рядом бегемотики

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 13519
Схватились за животики:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 13520
У них, у бегемотиков,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 13521
Животики болят.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 13522
И тут же страусята

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 13523
Визжат, как поросята.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 13524
Ах, жалко, жалко, жалко

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 13525
Бедных страусят!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 13526
И корь, и дифтерит у них,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 13527
И оспа, и бронхит у них,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 13528
И голова болит у них,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 13529
И горлышко болит.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 13530
Они лежат и бредят:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 13531
«Ну что же он не едет,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 13532
Ну что же он не едет,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 13533
Доктор Айболит?»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 13534
А рядом прикорнула

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 13535
Зубастая акула,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 13536
Зубастая акула

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 13537
На солнышке лежит.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 13538
Ах, у её малюток,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 13539
У бедных акулят,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 13540
Уже двенадцать суток

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 13541
Зубки болят!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 13542
И вывихнуто плечико

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 13543
У бедного кузнечика;

Не прыгает, не скачет он,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 13549
Но вот, поглядите, какая-то птица

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 13550
Всё ближе и ближе по воздуху мчится.

Он бежал по дорожке,

--- PAGE END ---

#TITLE: 13619
И ему перерезало ножки,

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 13620
И теперь он больной и хромой,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 13621
Маленький заинька мой!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 13622
И сказал Айболит: «Не беда!

#TITLE: 13623
Подавай-ка его сюда!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 13624
Я пришью ему новые ножки,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 13625
Он опять побежит по дорожке».

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 13626
И принесли к нему зайку,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 13627
Такого больного, хромого,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 13628
И доктор пришил ему ножки,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 13629
И заинька прыгает снова.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 13630
А с ним и зайчиха-мать

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 13631
Тоже пошла танцевать,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 13632
И смеётся она и кричит:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 13633
«Ну, спасибо тебе. Айболит!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 13634
Вдруг откуда-то шакал

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 13635
На кобыле прискакал:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 13636
«Вот вам телеграмма

#TITLE: 13637
От Гиппопотама!»

#TITLE: 13638
«Приезжайте, доктор,

В Африку скорей

И спасите, доктор,

Наших малышей!»

#TITLE: 13642
«Что такое? Неужели

--- PAGE END ---

Ваши дети заболели?»

#TITLE: 13644
«Да-да-да! У них ангина,

Скарлатина, холерина,

Приходите же скорее,

Вашим детям помогу.

#TITLE: 13652
Только где же вы живёте?

На горе или в болоте?»

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 13654
«Мы живём на Занзибаре,

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 13655
В Калахари и Сахаре,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 13656
На горе Фернандо-По,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 13657
Где гуляет Гиппо-по

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 13658
По широкой Лимпопо».

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 13659
И встал Айболит, побежал Айболит.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 13660
По полям, по лесам, по лугам он бежит.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 13661
И одно только слово твердит Айболит:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 13662
«Лимпопо, Лимпопо, Лимпопо!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 13663
А в лицо ему ветер, и снег, и град:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 13664
«Эй, Айболит, воротися назад!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 13665
И упал Айболит и лежит на снегу:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 13666
«Я дальше идти не могу».

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 13667
И сейчас же к нему из-за ёлки

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 13668
Выбегают мохнатые волки:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 13669
«Садись, Айболит, верхом,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 13670
Мы живо тебя довезём!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 13671
И вперёд поскакал Айболит

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 13672
И одно только слово твердит:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 13673
«Лимпопо, Лимпопо, Лимпопо!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 13674
Но вот перед ними море —

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 13675
Бушует, шумит на просторе.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 13676
А в море высокая ходит волна.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 13677
Сейчас Айболита проглотит она.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 13678
«О, если я утону,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 13679
Если пойду я ко дну,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 13680
Что станется с ними, с больными,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 13681
С моими зверями лесными?»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 13682
Но тут выплывает кит:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 13683
«Садись на меня, Айболит,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 13684
И, как большой пароход,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 13685
Тебя повезу я вперёд!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 13686
И сел на кита Айболит

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 13687
И одно только слово твердит:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 13688
«Лимпопо, Лимпопо, Лимпопо!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 13689
И горы встают перед ним на пути,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 13690
И он по горам начинает ползти,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 13691
А горы всё выше, а горы всё круче,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 13692
А горы уходят под самые тучи!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 13693
«О, если я не дойду,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 13694
Если в пути пропаду,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 13695
Что станется с ними, с больными,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 13696
С моими зверями лесными?»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 13697
И сейчас же с высокой скалы

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 13698
К Айболиту слетели орлы:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 13699
«Садись, Айболит, верхом,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 13700
Мы живо тебя довезём!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 13701
И сел на орла Айболит

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 13702
И одно только слово твердит:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 13703
«Лимпопо, Лимпопо, Лимпопо!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 13704
А в Африке,
А в Африке,


--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 13705
На чёрной
Лимпопо,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 13706
Сидит и плачет
В Африке

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 13707
Печальный Гиппопо.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 13708
Он в Африке, он в Африке

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 13709
Под пальмою сидит

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 13710
И на море из Африки

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 13711
Без отдыха глядит:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 13712
Не едет ли в кораблике

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 13713
Доктор Айболит?

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 13714
И рыщут по дороге

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 13715
Слоны и носороги

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 13716
И говорят сердито:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 13717
«Что ж нету Айболита?»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 13718
А рядом бегемотики

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 13719
Схватились за животики:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 13720
У них, у бегемотиков,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 13721
Животики болят.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 13722
И тут же страусята

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 13723
Визжат, как поросята.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 13724
Ах, жалко, жалко, жалко

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 13725
Бедных страусят!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 13726
И корь, и дифтерит у них,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 13727
И оспа, и бронхит у них,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 13728
И голова болит у них,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 13729
И горлышко болит.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 13730
Они лежат и бредят:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 13731
«Ну что же он не едет,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 13732
Ну что же он не едет,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 13733
Доктор Айболит?»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 13734
А рядом прикорнула

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 13735
Зубастая акула,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 13736
Зубастая акула

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 13737
На солнышке лежит.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 13738
Ах, у её малюток,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 13739
У бедных акулят,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 13740
Уже двенадцать суток

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 13741
Зубки болят!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 13742
И вывихнуто плечико

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 13743
У бедного кузнечика;

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 13744
Не прыгает, не скачет он,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 13745
А горько-горько плачет он

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 13746
И доктора зовёт:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 13747
«О, где же добрый доктор?

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 13748
Когда же он придёт?»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 13749
Но вот, поглядите, какая-то птица

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 13750
Всё ближе и ближе по воздуху мчится.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 13751
На птице, глядите, сидит Айболит

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 13752
И шляпою машет и громко кричит:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 13753
«Да здравствует милая Африка!»

Добрый доктор Айболит!

#TITLE: 13802
Он под деревом сидит.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 13803
Приходи к нему лечиться

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 13804
И корова, и волчица,

И жучок, и червячок,

#TITLE: 13808
Добрый доктор Айболит!

#TITLE: 13809
И пришла к Айболиту лиса:

#TITLE: 13810
«Ой, меня укусила оса!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 13811
И пришёл к Айболиту барбос:

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 13812
«Меня курица клюнула в нос!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 13813
И прибежала зайчиха

#TITLE: 13814
И закричала: «Ай, ай!

«Садись на меня, Айболит,

И, как большой пароход,

#TITLE: 13885
Тебя повезу я вперёд!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 13886
И сел на кита Айболит

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 13887
И одно только слово твердит:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 13888
«Лимпопо, Лимпопо, Лимпопо!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 13889
И горы встают перед ним на пути,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 13890
И он по горам начинает ползти,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 13891
А горы всё выше, а горы всё круче,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 13892
А горы уходят под самые тучи!

Доктор Айболит?

Схватились за животики:

У них, у бегемотиков,

Животики болят.

Визжат, как поросята.

Они лежат и бредят:

Зубастая акула

Уже двенадцать суток

Зубки болят!

--- PAGE END ---

#TITLE: 13942
И вывихнуто плечико

У бедного кузнечика;

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 13944
Не прыгает, не скачет он,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 13945
А горько-горько плачет он

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 13946
И доктора зовёт:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 13947
«О, где же добрый доктор?

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 13948
Когда же он придёт?»

#TITLE: 13949
Но вот, поглядите, какая-то птица

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 13950
Всё ближе и ближе по воздуху мчится.

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 13951
На птице, глядите, сидит Айболит

#TITLE: 13952
И шляпою машет и громко кричит:

#TITLE: 13953
«Да здравствует милая Африка!»

Добрый доктор Айболит!

#TITLE: 14002
Он под деревом сидит.

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 14003
Приходи к нему лечиться

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 14004
И корова, и волчица,

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 14005
И жучок, и червячок,

#TITLE: 14006
И медведица!

#TITLE: 14007
Всех излечит, исцелит

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 14008
Добрый доктор Айболит!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 14009
И пришла к Айболиту лиса:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 14010
«Ой, меня укусила оса!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 14011
И пришёл к Айболиту барбос:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 14012
«Меня курица клюнула в нос!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 14013
И прибежала зайчиха

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 14014
И закричала: «Ай, ай!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 14015
Мой зайчик попал под трамвай!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 14016
Мой зайчик, мой мальчик

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 14017
Попал под трамвай!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 14018
Он бежал по дорожке,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 14019
И ему перерезало ножки,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 14020
И теперь он больной и хромой,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 14021
Маленький заинька мой!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 14022
И сказал Айболит: «Не беда!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 14023
Подавай-ка его сюда!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 14024
Я пришью ему новые ножки,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 14025
Он опять побежит по дорожке».

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 14026
И принесли к нему зайку,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 14027
Такого больного, хромого,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 14028
И доктор пришил ему ножки,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 14029
И заинька прыгает снова.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 14030
А с ним и зайчиха-мать

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 14031
Тоже пошла танцевать,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 14032
И смеётся она и кричит:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 14033
«Ну, спасибо тебе. Айболит!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 14034
Вдруг откуда-то шакал

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 14035
На кобыле прискакал:

#TITLE: 14036
«Вот вам телеграмма

От Гиппопотама!»

#TITLE: 14038
«Приезжайте, доктор,

В Африку скорей

И спасите, доктор,

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 14042
«Что такое? Неужели

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 14043
Ваши дети заболели?»

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 14044
«Да-да-да! У них ангина,

Скарлатина, холерина,

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 14046
Дифтерит, аппендицит,

#TITLE: 14047
Малярия и бронхит!

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 14048
Приходите же скорее,

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 14049
Добрый доктор Айболит!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 14050
«Ладно, ладно, побегу,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 14051
Вашим детям помогу.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 14052
Только где же вы живёте?

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 14053
На горе или в болоте?»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 14054
«Мы живём на Занзибаре,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 14055
В Калахари и Сахаре,

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 14056
На горе Фернандо-По,

#TITLE: 14057
Где гуляет Гиппо-по

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 14058
По широкой Лимпопо».

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 14059
И встал Айболит, побежал Айболит.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 14060
По полям, по лесам, по лугам он бежит.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 14061
И одно только слово твердит Айболит:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 14062
«Лимпопо, Лимпопо, Лимпопо!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 14063
А в лицо ему ветер, и снег, и град:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 14064
«Эй, Айболит, воротися назад!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 14065
И упал Айболит и лежит на снегу:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 14066
«Я дальше идти не могу».

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 14067
И сейчас же к нему из-за ёлки

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 14068
Выбегают мохнатые волки:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 14069
«Садись, Айболит, верхом,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 14070
Мы живо тебя довезём!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 14071
И вперёд поскакал Айболит

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 14072
И одно только слово твердит:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 14073
«Лимпопо, Лимпопо, Лимпопо!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 14074
Но вот перед ними море —

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 14075
Бушует, шумит на просторе.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 14076
А в море высокая ходит волна.

Сейчас Айболита проглотит она.

Ах, у её малюток,

У бедных акулят,

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 14140
Уже двенадцать суток

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 14141
Зубки болят!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 14142
И вывихнуто плечико

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 14143
У бедного кузнечика;

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 14144
Не прыгает, не скачет он,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 14145
А горько-горько плачет он

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 14146
И доктора зовёт:

Всё ближе и ближе по воздуху мчится.

Добрый доктор Айболит!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 14202
Он под деревом сидит.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 14203
Приходи к нему лечиться

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 14204
И корова, и волчица,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 14205
И жучок, и червячок,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 14206
И медведица!

#TITLE: 14207
Всех излечит, исцелит

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 14208
Добрый доктор Айболит!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 14209
И пришла к Айболиту лиса:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 14210
«Ой, меня укусила оса!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 14211
И пришёл к Айболиту барбос:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 14212
«Меня курица клюнула в нос!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 14213
И прибежала зайчиха

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 14214
И закричала: «Ай, ай!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 14215
Мой зайчик попал под трамвай!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 14216
Мой зайчик, мой мальчик

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 14217
Попал под трамвай!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 14218
Он бежал по дорожке,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 14219
И ему перерезало ножки,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 14220
И теперь он больной и хромой,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 14221
Маленький заинька мой!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 14222
И сказал Айболит: «Не беда!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 14223
Подавай-ка его сюда!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 14224
Я пришью ему новые ножки,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 14225
Он опять побежит по дорожке».

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 14226
И принесли к нему зайку,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 14227
Такого больного, хромого,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 14228
И доктор пришил ему ножки,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 14229
И заинька прыгает снова.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 14230
А с ним и зайчиха-мать

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 14231
Тоже пошла танцевать,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 14232
И смеётся она и кричит:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 14233
«Ну, спасибо тебе. Айболит!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 14234
Вдруг откуда-то шакал

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 14235
На кобыле прискакал:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 14236
«Вот вам телеграмма

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 14237
От Гиппопотама!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 14238
«Приезжайте, доктор,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 14239
В Африку скорей

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 14240
И спасите, доктор,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 14241
Наших малышей!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 14242
«Что такое? Неужели

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 14243
Ваши дети заболели?»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 14244
«Да-да-да! У них ангина,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 14245
Скарлатина, холерина,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 14246
Дифтерит, аппендицит,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 14247
Малярия и бронхит!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 14248
Приходите же скорее,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 14249
Добрый доктор Айболит!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 14250
«Ладно, ладно, побегу,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 14251
Вашим детям помогу.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 14252
Только где же вы живёте?

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 14253
На горе или в болоте?»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 14254
«Мы живём на Занзибаре,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 14255
В Калахари и Сахаре,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 14256
На горе Фернандо-По,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 14257
Где гуляет Гиппо-по

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 14258
По широкой Лимпопо».

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 14259
И встал Айболит, побежал Айболит.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 14260
По полям, по лесам, по лугам он бежит.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 14261
И одно только слово твердит Айболит:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 14262
«Лимпопо, Лимпопо, Лимпопо!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 14263
А в лицо ему ветер, и снег, и град:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 14264
«Эй, Айболит, воротися назад!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 14265
И упал Айболит и лежит на снегу:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 14266
«Я дальше идти не могу».

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 14267
И сейчас же к нему из-за ёлки

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 14268
Выбегают мохнатые волки:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 14269
«Садись, Айболит, верхом,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 14270
Мы живо тебя довезём!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 14271
И вперёд поскакал Айболит

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 14272
И одно только слово твердит:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 14273
«Лимпопо, Лимпопо, Лимпопо!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 14274
Но вот перед ними море —

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 14275
Бушует, шумит на просторе.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 14276
А в море высокая ходит волна.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 14277
Сейчас Айболита проглотит она.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 14278
«О, если я утону,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 14279
Если пойду я ко дну,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 14280
Что станется с ними, с больными,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 14281
С моими зверями лесными?»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 14282
Но тут выплывает кит:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 14283
«Садись на меня, Айболит,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 14284
И, как большой пароход,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 14285
Тебя повезу я вперёд!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 14286
И сел на кита Айболит

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 14287
И одно только слово твердит:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 14288
«Лимпопо, Лимпопо, Лимпопо!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 14289
И горы встают перед ним на пути,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 14290
И он по горам начинает ползти,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 14291
А горы всё выше, а горы всё круче,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 14292
А горы уходят под самые тучи!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 14293
«О, если я не дойду,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 14294
Если в пути пропаду,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 14295
Что станется с ними, с больными,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 14296
С моими зверями лесными?»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 14297
И сейчас же с высокой скалы

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 14298
К Айболиту слетели орлы:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 14299
«Садись, Айболит, верхом,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 14300
Мы живо тебя довезём!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 14301
И сел на орла Айболит

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 14302
И одно только слово твердит:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 14303
«Лимпопо, Лимпопо, Лимпопо!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 14304
А в Африке,
А в Африке,


--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 14305
На чёрной
Лимпопо,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 14306
Сидит и плачет
В Африке

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 14307
Печальный Гиппопо.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 14308
Он в Африке, он в Африке

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 14309
Под пальмою сидит

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 14310
И на море из Африки

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 14311
Без отдыха глядит:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 14312
Не едет ли в кораблике

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 14313
Доктор Айболит?

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 14314
И рыщут по дороге

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 14315
Слоны и носороги

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 14316
И говорят сердито:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 14317
«Что ж нету Айболита?»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 14318
А рядом бегемотики

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 14319
Схватились за животики:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 14320
У них, у бегемотиков,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 14321
Животики болят.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 14322
И тут же страусята

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 14323
Визжат, как поросята.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 14324
Ах, жалко, жалко, жалко

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 14325
Бедных страусят!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 14326
И корь, и дифтерит у них,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 14327
И оспа, и бронхит у них,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 14328
И голова болит у них,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 14329
И горлышко болит.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 14330
Они лежат и бредят:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 14331
«Ну что же он не едет,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 14332
Ну что же он не едет,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 14333
Доктор Айболит?»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 14334
А рядом прикорнула

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 14335
Зубастая акула,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 14336
Зубастая акула

#TITLE: 14420

#TITLE: 14421
Маленький заинька мой!»

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 14422
И сказал Айболит: «Не беда!

Подавай-ка его сюда!

#TITLE: 14424

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 14426
И принесли к нему зайку,

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 14427
Такого больного, хромого,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 14428
И доктор пришил ему ножки,

#TITLE: 14431
Тоже пошла танцевать,

«Ну, спасибо тебе. Айболит!»

#TITLE: 14434
Вдруг откуда-то шакал

#TITLE: 14435
На кобыле прискакал:

«Вот вам телеграмма

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 14454
«Мы живём на Занзибаре,

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 14455
В Калахари и Сахаре,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 14456
На горе Фернандо-По,

#TITLE: 14457
Где гуляет Гиппо-по

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 14458
По широкой Лимпопо».

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 14459
И встал Айболит, побежал Айболит.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 14460
По полям, по лесам, по лугам он бежит.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 14461
И одно только слово твердит Айболит:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 14462
«Лимпопо, Лимпопо, Лимпопо!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 14463
А в лицо ему ветер, и снег, и град:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 14464
«Эй, Айболит, воротися назад!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 14465
И упал Айболит и лежит на снегу:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 14466
«Я дальше идти не могу».

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 14467
И сейчас же к нему из-за ёлки

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 14468
Выбегают мохнатые волки:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 14469
«Садись, Айболит, верхом,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 14470
Мы живо тебя довезём!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 14471
И вперёд поскакал Айболит

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 14472
И одно только слово твердит:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 14473
«Лимпопо, Лимпопо, Лимпопо!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 14474
Но вот перед ними море —

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 14475
Бушует, шумит на просторе.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 14476
А в море высокая ходит волна.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 14477
Сейчас Айболита проглотит она.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 14478
«О, если я утону,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 14479
Если пойду я ко дну,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 14480
Что станется с ними, с больными,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 14481
С моими зверями лесными?»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 14482
Но тут выплывает кит:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 14483
«Садись на меня, Айболит,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 14484
И, как большой пароход,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 14485
Тебя повезу я вперёд!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 14486
И сел на кита Айболит

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 14487
И одно только слово твердит:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 14488
«Лимпопо, Лимпопо, Лимпопо!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 14489
И горы встают перед ним на пути,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 14490
И он по горам начинает ползти,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 14491
А горы всё выше, а горы всё круче,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 14492
А горы уходят под самые тучи!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 14493
«О, если я не дойду,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 14494
Если в пути пропаду,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 14495
Что станется с ними, с больными,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 14496
С моими зверями лесными?»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 14497
И сейчас же с высокой скалы

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 14498
К Айболиту слетели орлы:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 14499
«Садись, Айболит, верхом,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 14500
Мы живо тебя довезём!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 14501
И сел на орла Айболит

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 14502
И одно только слово твердит:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 14503
«Лимпопо, Лимпопо, Лимпопо!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 14504
А в Африке,
А в Африке,


--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 14505
На чёрной
Лимпопо,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 14506
Сидит и плачет
В Африке

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 14507
Печальный Гиппопо.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 14508
Он в Африке, он в Африке

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 14509
Под пальмою сидит

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 14510
И на море из Африки

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 14511
Без отдыха глядит:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 14512
Не едет ли в кораблике

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 14513
Доктор Айболит?

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 14514
И рыщут по дороге

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 14515
Слоны и носороги

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 14516
И говорят сердито:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 14517
«Что ж нету Айболита?»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 14518
А рядом бегемотики

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 14519
Схватились за животики:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 14520
У них, у бегемотиков,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 14521
Животики болят.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 14522
И тут же страусята

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 14523
Визжат, как поросята.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 14524
Ах, жалко, жалко, жалко

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 14525
Бедных страусят!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 14526
И корь, и дифтерит у них,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 14527
И оспа, и бронхит у них,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 14528
И голова болит у них,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 14529
И горлышко болит.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 14530
Они лежат и бредят:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 14531
«Ну что же он не едет,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 14532
Ну что же он не едет,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 14533
Доктор Айболит?»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 14534
А рядом прикорнула

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 14535
Зубастая акула,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 14536
Зубастая акула

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 14537
На солнышке лежит.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 14538
Ах, у её малюток,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 14539
У бедных акулят,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 14540
Уже двенадцать суток

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 14541
Зубки болят!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 14542
И вывихнуто плечико

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 14543
У бедного кузнечика;

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 14544
Не прыгает, не скачет он,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 14545
А горько-горько плачет он

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 14546
И доктора зовёт:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 14547
«О, где же добрый доктор?

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 14548
Когда же он придёт?»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 14549
Но вот, поглядите, какая-то птица

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 14550
Всё ближе и ближе по воздуху мчится.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 14551
На птице, глядите, сидит Айболит

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 14552
И шляпою машет и громко кричит:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 14553
«Да здравствует милая Африка!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 14554
И рада и счастлива вся детвора:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 14555
«Приехал, приехал! Ура! Ура!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 14556
А птица над ними кружится,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 14557
А птица на землю садится.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 14558
И бежит Айболит к бегемотикам,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 14559
И хлопает их по животикам,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 14560
И всем по порядку

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 14561
Даёт шоколадку,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 14562
И ставит и ставит им градусники!

И одно только слово твердит Айболит:

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 14662
«Лимпопо, Лимпопо, Лимпопо!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 14663
А в лицо ему ветер, и снег, и град:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 14664
«Эй, Айболит, воротися назад!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 14665
И упал Айболит и лежит на снегу:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 14666
«Я дальше идти не могу».

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 14667
И сейчас же к нему из-за ёлки

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 14668
Выбегают мохнатые волки:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 14669
«Садись, Айболит, верхом,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 14670
Мы живо тебя довезём!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 14671
И вперёд поскакал Айболит

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 14672
И одно только слово твердит:

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 14673
«Лимпопо, Лимпопо, Лимпопо!»

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 14674
Но вот перед ними море —

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 14675
Бушует, шумит на просторе.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 14676
А в море высокая ходит волна.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 14677
Сейчас Айболита проглотит она.

«О, если я утону,

«Садись на меня, Айболит,

Тебя повезу я вперёд!»

#TITLE: 14690
И он по горам начинает ползти,

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 14691
А горы всё выше, а горы всё круче,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 14692
А горы уходят под самые тучи!

#TITLE: 14693
«О, если я не дойду,

На чёрной
Лимпопо,

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 14706
Сидит и плачет
В Африке

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 14707
Печальный Гиппопо.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 14708
Он в Африке, он в Африке

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 14709
Под пальмою сидит

И на море из Африки

#TITLE: 14711
Без отдыха глядит:

#TITLE: 14712
Не едет ли в кораблике

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 14713
Доктор Айболит?

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 14714
И рыщут по дороге

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 14715
Слоны и носороги

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 14716
И говорят сердито:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 14717
«Что ж нету Айболита?»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 14718
А рядом бегемотики

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 14719
Схватились за животики:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 14720
У них, у бегемотиков,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 14721
Животики болят.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 14722
И тут же страусята

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 14723
Визжат, как поросята.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 14724
Ах, жалко, жалко, жалко

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 14725
Бедных страусят!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 14726
И корь, и дифтерит у них,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 14727
И оспа, и бронхит у них,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 14728
И голова болит у них,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 14729
И горлышко болит.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 14730
Они лежат и бредят:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 14731
«Ну что же он не едет,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 14732
Ну что же он не едет,

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 14733
Доктор Айболит?»

--- PAGE END ---

А рядом прикорнула

#TITLE: 14735
Зубастая акула,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 14736
Зубастая акула

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 14737
На солнышке лежит.

Ах, у её малюток,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 14739
У бедных акулят,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 14740
Уже двенадцать суток

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 14741
Зубки болят!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 14742
И вывихнуто плечико

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 14743
У бедного кузнечика;

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 14744
Не прыгает, не скачет он,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 14745
А горько-горько плачет он

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 14746
И доктора зовёт:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 14747
«О, где же добрый доктор?

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 14748
Когда же он придёт?»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 14749
Но вот, поглядите, какая-то птица

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 14750
Всё ближе и ближе по воздуху мчится.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 14751
На птице, глядите, сидит Айболит

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 14752
И шляпою машет и громко кричит:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 14753
«Да здравствует милая Африка!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 14754
И рада и счастлива вся детвора:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 14755
«Приехал, приехал! Ура! Ура!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 14756
А птица над ними кружится,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 14757
А птица на землю садится.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 14758
И бежит Айболит к бегемотикам,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 14759
И хлопает их по животикам,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 14760
И всем по порядку

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 14761
Даёт шоколадку,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 14762
И ставит и ставит им градусники!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 14763
И к полосатым

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 14764
Бежит он тигрятам.

Добрый доктор Айболит!

#TITLE: 14802
Он под деревом сидит.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 14803
Приходи к нему лечиться

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 14804
И корова, и волчица,

--- PAGE START ---

И жучок, и червячок,

Всех излечит, исцелит

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 14808
Добрый доктор Айболит!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 14809
И пришла к Айболиту лиса:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 14810
«Ой, меня укусила оса!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 14811
И пришёл к Айболиту барбос:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 14812
«Меня курица клюнула в нос!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 14813
И прибежала зайчиха

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 14814
И закричала: «Ай, ай!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 14815
Мой зайчик попал под трамвай!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 14816
Мой зайчик, мой мальчик

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 14817
Попал под трамвай!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 14818
Он бежал по дорожке,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 14819
И ему перерезало ножки,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 14820
И теперь он больной и хромой,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 14821
Маленький заинька мой!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 14822
И сказал Айболит: «Не беда!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 14823
Подавай-ка его сюда!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 14824
Я пришью ему новые ножки,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 14825
Он опять побежит по дорожке».

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 14826
И принесли к нему зайку,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 14827
Такого больного, хромого,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 14828
И доктор пришил ему ножки,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 14829
И заинька прыгает снова.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 14830
А с ним и зайчиха-мать

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 14831
Тоже пошла танцевать,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 14832
И смеётся она и кричит:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 14833
«Ну, спасибо тебе. Айболит!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 14834
Вдруг откуда-то шакал

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 14835
На кобыле прискакал:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 14836
«Вот вам телеграмма

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 14837
От Гиппопотама!»

#TITLE: 14838
«Приезжайте, доктор,

#TITLE: 14842
«Что такое? Неужели

Ваши дети заболели?»

#TITLE: 14844
«Да-да-да! У них ангина,

#TITLE: 14845
Скарлатина, холерина,

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 14846
Дифтерит, аппендицит,

#TITLE: 14847
Малярия и бронхит!

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 14848
Приходите же скорее,

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 14849
Добрый доктор Айболит!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 14850
«Ладно, ладно, побегу,

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 14851
Вашим детям помогу.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 14852
Только где же вы живёте?

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 14853
На горе или в болоте?»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 14854
«Мы живём на Занзибаре,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 14855
В Калахари и Сахаре,

На горе Фернандо-По,

Где гуляет Гиппо-по

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 14858
По широкой Лимпопо».

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 14859
И встал Айболит, побежал Айболит.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 14860
По полям, по лесам, по лугам он бежит.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 14861
И одно только слово твердит Айболит:

#TITLE: 14862
«Лимпопо, Лимпопо, Лимпопо!»

Он под деревом сидит.

И корова, и волчица,

И пришла к Айболиту лиса:

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15010
«Ой, меня укусила оса!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15011
И пришёл к Айболиту барбос:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15012
«Меня курица клюнула в нос!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15013
И прибежала зайчиха

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15014
И закричала: «Ай, ай!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15015
Мой зайчик попал под трамвай!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15016
Мой зайчик, мой мальчик

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15017
Попал под трамвай!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15018
Он бежал по дорожке,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15019
И ему перерезало ножки,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15020
И теперь он больной и хромой,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15021
Маленький заинька мой!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15022
И сказал Айболит: «Не беда!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15023
Подавай-ка его сюда!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15024
Я пришью ему новые ножки,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15025
Он опять побежит по дорожке».

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15026
И принесли к нему зайку,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15027
Такого больного, хромого,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15028
И доктор пришил ему ножки,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15029
И заинька прыгает снова.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15030
А с ним и зайчиха-мать

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15031
Тоже пошла танцевать,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15032
И смеётся она и кричит:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15033
«Ну, спасибо тебе. Айболит!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15034
Вдруг откуда-то шакал

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15035
На кобыле прискакал:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15036
«Вот вам телеграмма

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15037
От Гиппопотама!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15038
«Приезжайте, доктор,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15039
В Африку скорей

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15040
И спасите, доктор,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15041
Наших малышей!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15042
«Что такое? Неужели

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15043
Ваши дети заболели?»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15044
«Да-да-да! У них ангина,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15045
Скарлатина, холерина,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15046
Дифтерит, аппендицит,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15047
Малярия и бронхит!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15048
Приходите же скорее,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15049
Добрый доктор Айболит!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15050
«Ладно, ладно, побегу,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15051
Вашим детям помогу.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15052
Только где же вы живёте?

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15053
На горе или в болоте?»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15054
«Мы живём на Занзибаре,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15055
В Калахари и Сахаре,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15056
На горе Фернандо-По,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15057
Где гуляет Гиппо-по

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15058
По широкой Лимпопо».

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15059
И встал Айболит, побежал Айболит.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15060
По полям, по лесам, по лугам он бежит.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15061
И одно только слово твердит Айболит:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15062
«Лимпопо, Лимпопо, Лимпопо!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15063
А в лицо ему ветер, и снег, и град:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15064
«Эй, Айболит, воротися назад!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15065
И упал Айболит и лежит на снегу:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15066
«Я дальше идти не могу».

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15067
И сейчас же к нему из-за ёлки

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15068
Выбегают мохнатые волки:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15069
«Садись, Айболит, верхом,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15070
Мы живо тебя довезём!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15071
И вперёд поскакал Айболит

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15072
И одно только слово твердит:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15073
«Лимпопо, Лимпопо, Лимпопо!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15074
Но вот перед ними море —

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15075
Бушует, шумит на просторе.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15076
А в море высокая ходит волна.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15077
Сейчас Айболита проглотит она.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15078
«О, если я утону,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15079
Если пойду я ко дну,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15080
Что станется с ними, с больными,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15081
С моими зверями лесными?»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15082
Но тут выплывает кит:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15083
«Садись на меня, Айболит,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15084
И, как большой пароход,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15085
Тебя повезу я вперёд!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15086
И сел на кита Айболит

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15087
И одно только слово твердит:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15088
«Лимпопо, Лимпопо, Лимпопо!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15089
И горы встают перед ним на пути,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15090
И он по горам начинает ползти,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15091
А горы всё выше, а горы всё круче,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15092
А горы уходят под самые тучи!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15093
«О, если я не дойду,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15094
Если в пути пропаду,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15095
Что станется с ними, с больными,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15096
С моими зверями лесными?»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15097
И сейчас же с высокой скалы

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15098
К Айболиту слетели орлы:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15099
«Садись, Айболит, верхом,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15100
Мы живо тебя довезём!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15101
И сел на орла Айболит

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15102
И одно только слово твердит:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15103
«Лимпопо, Лимпопо, Лимпопо!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15104
А в Африке,
А в Африке,


--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15105
На чёрной
Лимпопо,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15106
Сидит и плачет
В Африке

#TITLE: 15107
Печальный Гиппопо.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15108
Он в Африке, он в Африке

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15109
Под пальмою сидит

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15110
И на море из Африки

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15111
Без отдыха глядит:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15112
Не едет ли в кораблике

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15113
Доктор Айболит?

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15114
И рыщут по дороге

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15115
Слоны и носороги

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15116
И говорят сердито:

Добрый доктор Айболит!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15202
Он под деревом сидит.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15203
Приходи к нему лечиться

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15204
И корова, и волчица,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15205
И жучок, и червячок,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15206
И медведица!

И пришла к Айболиту лиса:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15210
«Ой, меня укусила оса!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15211
И пришёл к Айболиту барбос:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15212
«Меня курица клюнула в нос!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15213
И прибежала зайчиха

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15214
И закричала: «Ай, ай!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15215
Мой зайчик попал под трамвай!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15216
Мой зайчик, мой мальчик

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15217
Попал под трамвай!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15218
Он бежал по дорожке,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15219
И ему перерезало ножки,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15220
И теперь он больной и хромой,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15221
Маленький заинька мой!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15222
И сказал Айболит: «Не беда!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15223
Подавай-ка его сюда!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15224
Я пришью ему новые ножки,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15225
Он опять побежит по дорожке».

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15226
И принесли к нему зайку,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15227
Такого больного, хромого,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15228
И доктор пришил ему ножки,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15229
И заинька прыгает снова.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15230
А с ним и зайчиха-мать

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15231
Тоже пошла танцевать,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15232
И смеётся она и кричит:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15233
«Ну, спасибо тебе. Айболит!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15234
Вдруг откуда-то шакал

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15235
На кобыле прискакал:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15236
«Вот вам телеграмма

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15237
От Гиппопотама!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15238
«Приезжайте, доктор,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15239
В Африку скорей

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15240
И спасите, доктор,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15241
Наших малышей!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15242
«Что такое? Неужели

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15243
Ваши дети заболели?»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15244
«Да-да-да! У них ангина,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15245
Скарлатина, холерина,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15246
Дифтерит, аппендицит,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15247
Малярия и бронхит!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15248
Приходите же скорее,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15249
Добрый доктор Айболит!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15250
«Ладно, ладно, побегу,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15251
Вашим детям помогу.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15252
Только где же вы живёте?

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15253
На горе или в болоте?»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15254
«Мы живём на Занзибаре,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15255
В Калахари и Сахаре,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15256
На горе Фернандо-По,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15257
Где гуляет Гиппо-по

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15258
По широкой Лимпопо».

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15259
И встал Айболит, побежал Айболит.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15260
По полям, по лесам, по лугам он бежит.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15261
И одно только слово твердит Айболит:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15262
«Лимпопо, Лимпопо, Лимпопо!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15263
А в лицо ему ветер, и снег, и град:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15264
«Эй, Айболит, воротися назад!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15265
И упал Айболит и лежит на снегу:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15266
«Я дальше идти не могу».

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15267
И сейчас же к нему из-за ёлки

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15268
Выбегают мохнатые волки:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15269
«Садись, Айболит, верхом,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15270
Мы живо тебя довезём!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15271
И вперёд поскакал Айболит

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15272
И одно только слово твердит:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15273
«Лимпопо, Лимпопо, Лимпопо!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15274
Но вот перед ними море —

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15275
Бушует, шумит на просторе.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15276
А в море высокая ходит волна.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15277
Сейчас Айболита проглотит она.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15278
«О, если я утону,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15279
Если пойду я ко дну,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15280
Что станется с ними, с больными,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15281
С моими зверями лесными?»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15282
Но тут выплывает кит:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15283
«Садись на меня, Айболит,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15284
И, как большой пароход,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15285
Тебя повезу я вперёд!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15286
И сел на кита Айболит

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15287
И одно только слово твердит:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15288
«Лимпопо, Лимпопо, Лимпопо!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15289
И горы встают перед ним на пути,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15290
И он по горам начинает ползти,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15291
А горы всё выше, а горы всё круче,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15292
А горы уходят под самые тучи!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15293
«О, если я не дойду,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15294
Если в пути пропаду,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15295
Что станется с ними, с больными,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15296
С моими зверями лесными?»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15297
И сейчас же с высокой скалы

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15298
К Айболиту слетели орлы:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15299
«Садись, Айболит, верхом,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15300
Мы живо тебя довезём!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15301
И сел на орла Айболит

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15302
И одно только слово твердит:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15303
«Лимпопо, Лимпопо, Лимпопо!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15304
А в Африке,
А в Африке,


--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15305
На чёрной
Лимпопо,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15306
Сидит и плачет
В Африке

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15307
Печальный Гиппопо.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15308
Он в Африке, он в Африке

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15309
Под пальмою сидит

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15310
И на море из Африки

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15311
Без отдыха глядит:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15312
Не едет ли в кораблике

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15313
Доктор Айболит?

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15314
И рыщут по дороге

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15315
Слоны и носороги

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15316
И говорят сердито:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15317
«Что ж нету Айболита?»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15318
А рядом бегемотики

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15319
Схватились за животики:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15320
У них, у бегемотиков,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15321
Животики болят.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15322
И тут же страусята

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15323
Визжат, как поросята.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15324
Ах, жалко, жалко, жалко

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15325
Бедных страусят!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15326
И корь, и дифтерит у них,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15327
И оспа, и бронхит у них,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15328
И голова болит у них,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15329
И горлышко болит.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15330
Они лежат и бредят:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15331
«Ну что же он не едет,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15332
Ну что же он не едет,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15333
Доктор Айболит?»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15334
А рядом прикорнула

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15335
Зубастая акула,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15336
Зубастая акула

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15337
На солнышке лежит.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15338
Ах, у её малюток,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15339
У бедных акулят,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15340
Уже двенадцать суток

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15341
Зубки болят!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15342
И вывихнуто плечико

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15343
У бедного кузнечика;

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15344
Не прыгает, не скачет он,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15345
А горько-горько плачет он

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15346
И доктора зовёт:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15347
«О, где же добрый доктор?

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15348
Когда же он придёт?»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15349
Но вот, поглядите, какая-то птица

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15350
Всё ближе и ближе по воздуху мчится.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15351
На птице, глядите, сидит Айболит

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15352
И шляпою машет и громко кричит:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15353
«Да здравствует милая Африка!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15354
И рада и счастлива вся детвора:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15355
«Приехал, приехал! Ура! Ура!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15356
А птица над ними кружится,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15357
А птица на землю садится.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15358
И бежит Айболит к бегемотикам,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15359
И хлопает их по животикам,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15360
И всем по порядку

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15361
Даёт шоколадку,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15362
И ставит и ставит им градусники!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15363
И к полосатым

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15364
Бежит он тигрятам.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15365
И к бедным горбатым

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15366
Больным верблюжатам,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15367
И каждого гоголем,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15368
Каждого моголем,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15369
Гоголем-моголем,

#TITLE: 15458
По широкой Лимпопо».

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15459
И встал Айболит, побежал Айболит.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15460
По полям, по лесам, по лугам он бежит.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15461
И одно только слово твердит Айболит:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15462
«Лимпопо, Лимпопо, Лимпопо!»

--- PAGE END ---

#TITLE: 15463

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15464
«Эй, Айболит, воротися назад!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15465
И упал Айболит и лежит на снегу:

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15466
«Я дальше идти не могу».

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15467
И сейчас же к нему из-за ёлки

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15468
Выбегают мохнатые волки:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15469
«Садись, Айболит, верхом,

«Лимпопо, Лимпопо, Лимпопо!»

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15474
Но вот перед ними море —

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15475
Бушует, шумит на просторе.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15476
А в море высокая ходит волна.

Сейчас Айболита проглотит она.

«О, если я утону,

«Садись на меня, Айболит,

И, как большой пароход,

#TITLE: 15489
И горы встают перед ним на пути,

И он по горам начинает ползти,

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15491
А горы всё выше, а горы всё круче,

#TITLE: 15492
А горы уходят под самые тучи!

#TITLE: 15498
К Айболиту слетели орлы:

«Садись, Айболит, верхом,

#TITLE: 15501
И сел на орла Айболит

И одно только слово твердит:

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15503
«Лимпопо, Лимпопо, Лимпопо!»

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15504
А в Африке,
А в Африке,


--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15505
На чёрной
Лимпопо,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15506
Сидит и плачет
В Африке

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15507
Печальный Гиппопо.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15508
Он в Африке, он в Африке

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15509
Под пальмою сидит

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15510
И на море из Африки

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15511
Без отдыха глядит:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15512
Не едет ли в кораблике

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15513
Доктор Айболит?

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15514
И рыщут по дороге

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15515
Слоны и носороги

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15516
И говорят сердито:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15517
«Что ж нету Айболита?»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15518
А рядом бегемотики

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15519
Схватились за животики:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15520
У них, у бегемотиков,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15521
Животики болят.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15522
И тут же страусята

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15523
Визжат, как поросята.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15524
Ах, жалко, жалко, жалко

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15525
Бедных страусят!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15526
И корь, и дифтерит у них,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15527
И оспа, и бронхит у них,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15528
И голова болит у них,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15529
И горлышко болит.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15530
Они лежат и бредят:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15531
«Ну что же он не едет,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15532
Ну что же он не едет,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15533
Доктор Айболит?»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15534
А рядом прикорнула

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15535
Зубастая акула,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15536
Зубастая акула

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15537
На солнышке лежит.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15538
Ах, у её малюток,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15539
У бедных акулят,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15540
Уже двенадцать суток

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15541
Зубки болят!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15542
И вывихнуто плечико

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15543
У бедного кузнечика;

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15544
Не прыгает, не скачет он,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15545
А горько-горько плачет он

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15546
И доктора зовёт:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15547
«О, где же добрый доктор?

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15548
Когда же он придёт?»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15549
Но вот, поглядите, какая-то птица

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15550
Всё ближе и ближе по воздуху мчится.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15551
На птице, глядите, сидит Айболит

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15552
И шляпою машет и громко кричит:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15553
«Да здравствует милая Африка!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15554
И рада и счастлива вся детвора:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15555
«Приехал, приехал! Ура! Ура!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15556
А птица над ними кружится,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15557
А птица на землю садится.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15558
И бежит Айболит к бегемотикам,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15559
И хлопает их по животикам,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15560
И всем по порядку

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15561
Даёт шоколадку,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15562
И ставит и ставит им градусники!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15563
И к полосатым

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15564
Бежит он тигрятам.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15565
И к бедным горбатым

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15566
Больным верблюжатам,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15567
И каждого гоголем,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15568
Каждого моголем,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15569
Гоголем-моголем,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15570
Гоголем-моголем,

Гоголем-моголем потчует.

Добрый доктор Айболит!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15602
Он под деревом сидит.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15603
Приходи к нему лечиться

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15604
И корова, и волчица,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15605
И жучок, и червячок,

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15606
И медведица!

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15607
Всех излечит, исцелит

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15608
Добрый доктор Айболит!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15609
И пришла к Айболиту лиса:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15610
«Ой, меня укусила оса!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15611
И пришёл к Айболиту барбос:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15612
«Меня курица клюнула в нос!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15613
И прибежала зайчиха

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15614
И закричала: «Ай, ай!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15615
Мой зайчик попал под трамвай!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15616
Мой зайчик, мой мальчик

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15617
Попал под трамвай!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15618
Он бежал по дорожке,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15619
И ему перерезало ножки,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15620
И теперь он больной и хромой,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15621
Маленький заинька мой!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15622
И сказал Айболит: «Не беда!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15623
Подавай-ка его сюда!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15624
Я пришью ему новые ножки,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15625
Он опять побежит по дорожке».

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15626
И принесли к нему зайку,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15627
Такого больного, хромого,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15428
И доктор пришил ему ножки,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15629
И заинька прыгает снова.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15630
А с ним и зайчиха-мать

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15631
Тоже пошла танцевать,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15632
И смеётся она и кричит:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15633
«Ну, спасибо тебе. Айболит!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15634
Вдруг откуда-то шакал

#TITLE: 15635
На кобыле прискакал:

«Лимпопо, Лимпопо, Лимпопо!»

#TITLE: 15689
И горы встают перед ним на пути,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15690
И он по горам начинает ползти,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15691
А горы всё выше, а горы всё круче,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15692
А горы уходят под самые тучи!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15693
«О, если я не дойду,

Если в пути пропаду,

И сейчас же с высокой скалы

#TITLE: 15698
К Айболиту слетели орлы:

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15699
«Садись, Айболит, верхом,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15700
Мы живо тебя довезём!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15701
И сел на орла Айболит

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15702
И одно только слово твердит:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15703
«Лимпопо, Лимпопо, Лимпопо!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15704
А в Африке,
А в Африке,


--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15705
На чёрной
Лимпопо,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15706
Сидит и плачет
В Африке

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15707
Печальный Гиппопо.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15708
Он в Африке, он в Африке

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15709
Под пальмою сидит

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15710
И на море из Африки

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15711
Без отдыха глядит:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15712
Не едет ли в кораблике

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15713
Доктор Айболит?

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15714
И рыщут по дороге

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15715
Слоны и носороги

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15716
И говорят сердито:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15717
«Что ж нету Айболита?»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15718
А рядом бегемотики

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15719
Схватились за животики:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15720
У них, у бегемотиков,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15721
Животики болят.

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15722
И тут же страусята

Визжат, как поросята.

#TITLE: 15725
Бедных страусят!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15726
И корь, и дифтерит у них,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15727
И оспа, и бронхит у них,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15728
И голова болит у них,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15729
И горлышко болит.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15730
Они лежат и бредят:

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15731
«Ну что же он не едет,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15732
Ну что же он не едет,

#TITLE: 15733
Доктор Айболит?»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15734
А рядом прикорнула

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15735
Зубастая акула,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15736
Зубастая акула

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15737
На солнышке лежит.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15738
Ах, у её малюток,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15739
У бедных акулят,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15740
Уже двенадцать суток

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15741
Зубки болят!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15742
И вывихнуто плечико

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15743
У бедного кузнечика;

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15744
Не прыгает, не скачет он,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15745
А горько-горько плачет он

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15746
И доктора зовёт:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15747
«О, где же добрый доктор?

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15748
Когда же он придёт?»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15749
Но вот, поглядите, какая-то птица

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15750
Всё ближе и ближе по воздуху мчится.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15751
На птице, глядите, сидит Айболит

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15752
И шляпою машет и громко кричит:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15753
«Да здравствует милая Африка!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15754
И рада и счастлива вся детвора:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15755
«Приехал, приехал! Ура! Ура!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15756
А птица над ними кружится,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15757
А птица на землю садится.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15758
И бежит Айболит к бегемотикам,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15759
И хлопает их по животикам,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15760
И всем по порядку

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15761
Даёт шоколадку,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15762
И ставит и ставит им градусники!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15763
И к полосатым

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15764
Бежит он тигрятам.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15765
И к бедным горбатым

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15766
Больным верблюжатам,

И каждого гоголем,

Каждого моголем,

Гоголем-моголем,

Гоголем-моголем,

Гоголем-моголем потчует.

#TITLE: 15801
Добрый доктор Айболит!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15802
Он под деревом сидит.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15803
Приходи к нему лечиться

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15804
И корова, и волчица,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15805
И жучок, и червячок,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15806
И медведица!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15807
Всех излечит, исцелит

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15808
Добрый доктор Айболит!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15809
И пришла к Айболиту лиса:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15810
«Ой, меня укусила оса!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15811
И пришёл к Айболиту барбос:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15812
«Меня курица клюнула в нос!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15813
И прибежала зайчиха

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15814
И закричала: «Ай, ай!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15815
Мой зайчик попал под трамвай!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15816
Мой зайчик, мой мальчик

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15817
Попал под трамвай!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15818
Он бежал по дорожке,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15819
И ему перерезало ножки,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15820
И теперь он больной и хромой,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15821
Маленький заинька мой!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15822
И сказал Айболит: «Не беда!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15823
Подавай-ка его сюда!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15824
Я пришью ему новые ножки,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15825
Он опять побежит по дорожке».

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15826
И принесли к нему зайку,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15827
Такого больного, хромого,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15828
И доктор пришил ему ножки,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15829
И заинька прыгает снова.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15830
А с ним и зайчиха-мать

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15831
Тоже пошла танцевать,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15832
И смеётся она и кричит:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15833
«Ну, спасибо тебе. Айболит!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15834
Вдруг откуда-то шакал

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15835
На кобыле прискакал:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15836
«Вот вам телеграмма

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15837
От Гиппопотама!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15838
«Приезжайте, доктор,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15839
В Африку скорей

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15840
И спасите, доктор,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15841
Наших малышей!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15842
«Что такое? Неужели

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15843
Ваши дети заболели?»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15844
«Да-да-да! У них ангина,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15845
Скарлатина, холерина,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15846
Дифтерит, аппендицит,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15847
Малярия и бронхит!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15848
Приходите же скорее,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15849
Добрый доктор Айболит!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15850
«Ладно, ладно, побегу,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15851
Вашим детям помогу.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15852
Только где же вы живёте?

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15853
На горе или в болоте?»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15854
«Мы живём на Занзибаре,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15855
В Калахари и Сахаре,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15856
На горе Фернандо-По,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15857
Где гуляет Гиппо-по

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15858
По широкой Лимпопо».

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15859
И встал Айболит, побежал Айболит.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15860
По полям, по лесам, по лугам он бежит.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15861
И одно только слово твердит Айболит:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15862
«Лимпопо, Лимпопо, Лимпопо!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15863
А в лицо ему ветер, и снег, и град:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15864
«Эй, Айболит, воротися назад!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15865
И упал Айболит и лежит на снегу:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15866
«Я дальше идти не могу».

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15867
И сейчас же к нему из-за ёлки

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15868
Выбегают мохнатые волки:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15869
«Садись, Айболит, верхом,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15870
Мы живо тебя довезём!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15871
И вперёд поскакал Айболит

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15872
И одно только слово твердит:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15873
«Лимпопо, Лимпопо, Лимпопо!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15874
Но вот перед ними море —

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15875
Бушует, шумит на просторе.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15876
А в море высокая ходит волна.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15877
Сейчас Айболита проглотит она.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15878
«О, если я утону,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15879
Если пойду я ко дну,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15880
Что станется с ними, с больными,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15881
С моими зверями лесными?»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15882
Но тут выплывает кит:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15883
«Садись на меня, Айболит,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15884
И, как большой пароход,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15885
Тебя повезу я вперёд!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15886
И сел на кита Айболит

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15887
И одно только слово твердит:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15888
«Лимпопо, Лимпопо, Лимпопо!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15889
И горы встают перед ним на пути,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15890
И он по горам начинает ползти,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15891
А горы всё выше, а горы всё круче,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15892
А горы уходят под самые тучи!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15893
«О, если я не дойду,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15894
Если в пути пропаду,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15895
Что станется с ними, с больными,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15896
С моими зверями лесными?»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15897
И сейчас же с высокой скалы

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15898
К Айболиту слетели орлы:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15899
«Садись, Айболит, верхом,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15900
Мы живо тебя довезём!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15901
И сел на орла Айболит

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 15902
И одно только слово твердит:

#TITLE: 15903
«Лимпопо, Лимпопо, Лимпопо!»

Не прыгает, не скачет он,

Даёт шоколадку,

Добрый доктор Айболит!

Он под деревом сидит.

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16003
Приходи к нему лечиться

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16004
И корова, и волчица,

И жучок, и червячок,

Добрый доктор Айболит!

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16009
И пришла к Айболиту лиса:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16010
«Ой, меня укусила оса!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16011
И пришёл к Айболиту барбос:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16012
«Меня курица клюнула в нос!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16013
И прибежала зайчиха

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16014
И закричала: «Ай, ай!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16015
Мой зайчик попал под трамвай!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16016
Мой зайчик, мой мальчик

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16017
Попал под трамвай!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16018
Он бежал по дорожке,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16019
И ему перерезало ножки,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16020
И теперь он больной и хромой,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16021
Маленький заинька мой!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16022
И сказал Айболит: «Не беда!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16023
Подавай-ка его сюда!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16024
Я пришью ему новые ножки,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16025
Он опять побежит по дорожке».

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16026
И принесли к нему зайку,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16027
Такого больного, хромого,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16028
И доктор пришил ему ножки,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16029
И заинька прыгает снова.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16030
А с ним и зайчиха-мать

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16031
Тоже пошла танцевать,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16032
И смеётся она и кричит:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16033
«Ну, спасибо тебе. Айболит!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16034
Вдруг откуда-то шакал

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16035
На кобыле прискакал:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16036
«Вот вам телеграмма

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16037
От Гиппопотама!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16038
«Приезжайте, доктор,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16039
В Африку скорей

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16040
И спасите, доктор,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16041
Наших малышей!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16042
«Что такое? Неужели

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16043
Ваши дети заболели?»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16044
«Да-да-да! У них ангина,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16045
Скарлатина, холерина,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16046
Дифтерит, аппендицит,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16047
Малярия и бронхит!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16048
Приходите же скорее,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16049
Добрый доктор Айболит!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16050
«Ладно, ладно, побегу,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16051
Вашим детям помогу.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16052
Только где же вы живёте?

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16053
На горе или в болоте?»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16054
«Мы живём на Занзибаре,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16055
В Калахари и Сахаре,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16056
На горе Фернандо-По,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16057
Где гуляет Гиппо-по

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16058
По широкой Лимпопо».

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16059
И встал Айболит, побежал Айболит.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16060
По полям, по лесам, по лугам он бежит.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16061
И одно только слово твердит Айболит:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16062
«Лимпопо, Лимпопо, Лимпопо!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16063
А в лицо ему ветер, и снег, и град:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16064
«Эй, Айболит, воротися назад!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16065
И упал Айболит и лежит на снегу:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16066
«Я дальше идти не могу».

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16067
И сейчас же к нему из-за ёлки

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16068
Выбегают мохнатые волки:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16069
«Садись, Айболит, верхом,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16070
Мы живо тебя довезём!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16071
И вперёд поскакал Айболит

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16072
И одно только слово твердит:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16073
«Лимпопо, Лимпопо, Лимпопо!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16074
Но вот перед ними море —

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16075
Бушует, шумит на просторе.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16076
А в море высокая ходит волна.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16077
Сейчас Айболита проглотит она.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16078
«О, если я утону,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16079
Если пойду я ко дну,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16080
Что станется с ними, с больными,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16081
С моими зверями лесными?»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16082
Но тут выплывает кит:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16083
«Садись на меня, Айболит,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16084
И, как большой пароход,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16085
Тебя повезу я вперёд!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16086
И сел на кита Айболит

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16087
И одно только слово твердит:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16088
«Лимпопо, Лимпопо, Лимпопо!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16089
И горы встают перед ним на пути,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16090
И он по горам начинает ползти,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16091
А горы всё выше, а горы всё круче,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16092
А горы уходят под самые тучи!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16093
«О, если я не дойду,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16094
Если в пути пропаду,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16095
Что станется с ними, с больными,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16096
С моими зверями лесными?»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16097
И сейчас же с высокой скалы

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16098
К Айболиту слетели орлы:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16099
«Садись, Айболит, верхом,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16100
Мы живо тебя довезём!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16101
И сел на орла Айболит

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16102
И одно только слово твердит:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16103
«Лимпопо, Лимпопо, Лимпопо!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16104
А в Африке,
А в Африке,


--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16105
На чёрной
Лимпопо,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16106
Сидит и плачет
В Африке

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16107
Печальный Гиппопо.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16108
Он в Африке, он в Африке

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16109
Под пальмою сидит

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16110
И на море из Африки

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16111
Без отдыха глядит:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16112
Не едет ли в кораблике

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16113
Доктор Айболит?

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16114
И рыщут по дороге

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16115
Слоны и носороги

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16116
И говорят сердито:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16117
«Что ж нету Айболита?»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16118
А рядом бегемотики

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16119
Схватились за животики:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16120
У них, у бегемотиков,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16121
Животики болят.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16122
И тут же страусята

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16123
Визжат, как поросята.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16124
Ах, жалко, жалко, жалко

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16125
Бедных страусят!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16126
И корь, и дифтерит у них,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16127
И оспа, и бронхит у них,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16128
И голова болит у них,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16129
И горлышко болит.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16130
Они лежат и бредят:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16131
«Ну что же он не едет,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16132
Ну что же он не едет,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16133
Доктор Айболит?»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16134
А рядом прикорнула

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16135
Зубастая акула,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16136
Зубастая акула

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16137
На солнышке лежит.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16138
Ах, у её малюток,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16139
У бедных акулят,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16140
Уже двенадцать суток

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16141
Зубки болят!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16142
И вывихнуто плечико

--- PAGE END ---

У бедного кузнечика;

Не прыгает, не скачет он,

#TITLE: 16201
Добрый доктор Айболит!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16202
Он под деревом сидит.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16203
Приходи к нему лечиться

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16204
И корова, и волчица,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16205
И жучок, и червячок,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16206
И медведица!

#TITLE: 16207
Всех излечит, исцелит

«Ой, меня укусила оса!»

«Меня курица клюнула в нос!»

#TITLE: 16213
И прибежала зайчиха

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16214
И закричала: «Ай, ай!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16215
Мой зайчик попал под трамвай!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16216
Мой зайчик, мой мальчик

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16217
Попал под трамвай!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16218
Он бежал по дорожке,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16219
И ему перерезало ножки,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16220
И теперь он больной и хромой,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16221
Маленький заинька мой!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16222
И сказал Айболит: «Не беда!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16223
Подавай-ка его сюда!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16224
Я пришью ему новые ножки,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16225
Он опять побежит по дорожке».

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16226
И принесли к нему зайку,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16227
Такого больного, хромого,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16228
И доктор пришил ему ножки,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16229
И заинька прыгает снова.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16230
А с ним и зайчиха-мать

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16231
Тоже пошла танцевать,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16232
И смеётся она и кричит:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16233
«Ну, спасибо тебе. Айболит!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16234
Вдруг откуда-то шакал

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16235
На кобыле прискакал:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16236
«Вот вам телеграмма

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16237
От Гиппопотама!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16238
«Приезжайте, доктор,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16239
В Африку скорей

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16240
И спасите, доктор,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16241
Наших малышей!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16242
«Что такое? Неужели

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16243
Ваши дети заболели?»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16244
«Да-да-да! У них ангина,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16245
Скарлатина, холерина,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16246
Дифтерит, аппендицит,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16247
Малярия и бронхит!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16248
Приходите же скорее,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16249
Добрый доктор Айболит!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16250
«Ладно, ладно, побегу,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16251
Вашим детям помогу.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16252
Только где же вы живёте?

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16253
На горе или в болоте?»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16254
«Мы живём на Занзибаре,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16255
В Калахари и Сахаре,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16256
На горе Фернандо-По,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16257
Где гуляет Гиппо-по

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16258
По широкой Лимпопо».

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16259
И встал Айболит, побежал Айболит.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16260
По полям, по лесам, по лугам он бежит.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16261
И одно только слово твердит Айболит:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16262
«Лимпопо, Лимпопо, Лимпопо!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16263
А в лицо ему ветер, и снег, и град:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16264
«Эй, Айболит, воротися назад!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16265
И упал Айболит и лежит на снегу:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16266
«Я дальше идти не могу».

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16267
И сейчас же к нему из-за ёлки

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16268
Выбегают мохнатые волки:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16269
«Садись, Айболит, верхом,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16270
Мы живо тебя довезём!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16271
И вперёд поскакал Айболит

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16272
И одно только слово твердит:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16273
«Лимпопо, Лимпопо, Лимпопо!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16274
Но вот перед ними море —

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16275
Бушует, шумит на просторе.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16276
А в море высокая ходит волна.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16277
Сейчас Айболита проглотит она.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16278
«О, если я утону,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16279
Если пойду я ко дну,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16280
Что станется с ними, с больными,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16281
С моими зверями лесными?»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16282
Но тут выплывает кит:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16283
«Садись на меня, Айболит,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16284
И, как большой пароход,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16285
Тебя повезу я вперёд!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16286
И сел на кита Айболит

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16287
И одно только слово твердит:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16288
«Лимпопо, Лимпопо, Лимпопо!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16289
И горы встают перед ним на пути,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16290
И он по горам начинает ползти,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16291
А горы всё выше, а горы всё круче,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16292
А горы уходят под самые тучи!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16293
«О, если я не дойду,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16294
Если в пути пропаду,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16295
Что станется с ними, с больными,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16296
С моими зверями лесными?»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16297
И сейчас же с высокой скалы

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16298
К Айболиту слетели орлы:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16299
«Садись, Айболит, верхом,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16300
Мы живо тебя довезём!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16301
И сел на орла Айболит

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16302
И одно только слово твердит:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16303
«Лимпопо, Лимпопо, Лимпопо!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16304
А в Африке,
А в Африке,


--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16305
На чёрной
Лимпопо,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16306
Сидит и плачет
В Африке

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16307
Печальный Гиппопо.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16308
Он в Африке, он в Африке

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16309
Под пальмою сидит

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16310
И на море из Африки

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16311
Без отдыха глядит:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16312
Не едет ли в кораблике

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16313
Доктор Айболит?

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16314
И рыщут по дороге

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16315
Слоны и носороги

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16316
И говорят сердито:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16317
«Что ж нету Айболита?»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16318
А рядом бегемотики

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16319
Схватились за животики:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16320
У них, у бегемотиков,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16321
Животики болят.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16322
И тут же страусята

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16323
Визжат, как поросята.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16324
Ах, жалко, жалко, жалко

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16325
Бедных страусят!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16326
И корь, и дифтерит у них,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16327
И оспа, и бронхит у них,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16328
И голова болит у них,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16329
И горлышко болит.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16330
Они лежат и бредят:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16331
«Ну что же он не едет,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16332
Ну что же он не едет,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16333
Доктор Айболит?»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16334
А рядом прикорнула

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16335
Зубастая акула,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16336
Зубастая акула

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16337
На солнышке лежит.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16338
Ах, у её малюток,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16339
У бедных акулят,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16340
Уже двенадцать суток

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16341
Зубки болят!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16342
И вывихнуто плечико

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16343
У бедного кузнечика;

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16344
Не прыгает, не скачет он,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16345
А горько-горько плачет он

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16346
И доктора зовёт:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16347
«О, где же добрый доктор?

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16348
Когда же он придёт?»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16349
Но вот, поглядите, какая-то птица

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16350
Всё ближе и ближе по воздуху мчится.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16351
На птице, глядите, сидит Айболит

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16352
И шляпою машет и громко кричит:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16353
«Да здравствует милая Африка!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16354
И рада и счастлива вся детвора:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16355
«Приехал, приехал! Ура! Ура!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16356
А птица над ними кружится,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16357
А птица на землю садится.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16358
И бежит Айболит к бегемотикам,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16359
И хлопает их по животикам,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16360
И всем по порядку

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16361
Даёт шоколадку,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16362
И ставит и ставит им градусники!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16363
И к полосатым

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16364
Бежит он тигрятам.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16365
И к бедным горбатым

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16366
Больным верблюжатам,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16367
И каждого гоголем,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16368
Каждого моголем,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16369
Гоголем-моголем,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16370
Гоголем-моголем,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16371
Гоголем-моголем потчует.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16372
Десять ночей Айболит

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16373
Не ест, не пьёт и не спит,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16374
Десять ночей подряд

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16375
Он лечит несчастных зверят

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16376
И ставит и ставит им градусники.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16377
Вот и вылечил он их, 
Лимпопо!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16378
Вот и вылечил больных, 
Лимпопо!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16379
И пошли они смеяться,
Лимпопо!


--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16380
И плясать и баловаться, 
Лимпопо!

Он опять побежит по дорожке».

#TITLE: 16426
И принесли к нему зайку,

Такого больного, хромого,

«Ладно, ладно, побегу,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16451
Вашим детям помогу.

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16452
Только где же вы живёте?

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16453
На горе или в болоте?»

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16454
«Мы живём на Занзибаре,

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16455
В Калахари и Сахаре,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16456
На горе Фернандо-По,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16457
Где гуляет Гиппо-по

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16458
По широкой Лимпопо».

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16459
И встал Айболит, побежал Айболит.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16460
По полям, по лесам, по лугам он бежит.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16461
И одно только слово твердит Айболит:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16462
«Лимпопо, Лимпопо, Лимпопо!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16463
А в лицо ему ветер, и снег, и град:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16464
«Эй, Айболит, воротися назад!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16465
И упал Айболит и лежит на снегу:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16466
«Я дальше идти не могу».

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16467
И сейчас же к нему из-за ёлки

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16468
Выбегают мохнатые волки:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16469
«Садись, Айболит, верхом,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16470
Мы живо тебя довезём!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16471
И вперёд поскакал Айболит

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16472
И одно только слово твердит:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16473
«Лимпопо, Лимпопо, Лимпопо!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16474
Но вот перед ними море —

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16475
Бушует, шумит на просторе.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16476
А в море высокая ходит волна.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16477
Сейчас Айболита проглотит она.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16478
«О, если я утону,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16479
Если пойду я ко дну,

#TITLE: 16481
С моими зверями лесными?»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16482
Но тут выплывает кит:

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16483
«Садись на меня, Айболит,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16484
И, как большой пароход,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16485
Тебя повезу я вперёд!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16486
И сел на кита Айболит

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16487
И одно только слово твердит:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16488
«Лимпопо, Лимпопо, Лимпопо!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16489
И горы встают перед ним на пути,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16490
И он по горам начинает ползти,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16491
А горы всё выше, а горы всё круче,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16492
А горы уходят под самые тучи!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16493
«О, если я не дойду,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16494
Если в пути пропаду,

#TITLE: 16495
Что станется с ними, с больными,

#TITLE: 16496
С моими зверями лесными?»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16497
И сейчас же с высокой скалы

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16498
К Айболиту слетели орлы:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16499
«Садись, Айболит, верхом,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16500
Мы живо тебя довезём!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16501
И сел на орла Айболит

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16502
И одно только слово твердит:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16503
«Лимпопо, Лимпопо, Лимпопо!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16504
А в Африке,
А в Африке,

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16505
На чёрной
Лимпопо,

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16506
Сидит и плачет
В Африке

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16507
Печальный Гиппопо.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16508
Он в Африке, он в Африке

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16509
Под пальмою сидит

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16510
И на море из Африки

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16511
Без отдыха глядит:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16512
Не едет ли в кораблике

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16513
Доктор Айболит?

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16514
И рыщут по дороге

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16515
Слоны и носороги

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16516
И говорят сердито:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16517
«Что ж нету Айболита?»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16518
А рядом бегемотики

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16519
Схватились за животики:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16520
У них, у бегемотиков,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16521
Животики болят.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16522
И тут же страусята

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16523
Визжат, как поросята.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16524
Ах, жалко, жалко, жалко

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16525
Бедных страусят!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16526
И корь, и дифтерит у них,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16527
И оспа, и бронхит у них,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16528
И голова болит у них,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16529
И горлышко болит.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16530
Они лежат и бредят:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16531
«Ну что же он не едет,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16532
Ну что же он не едет,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16533
Доктор Айболит?»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16534
А рядом прикорнула

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16535
Зубастая акула,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16536
Зубастая акула

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16537
На солнышке лежит.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16538
Ах, у её малюток,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16539
У бедных акулят,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16540
Уже двенадцать суток

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16541
Зубки болят!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16542
И вывихнуто плечико

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16543
У бедного кузнечика;

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16544
Не прыгает, не скачет он,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16545
А горько-горько плачет он

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16546
И доктора зовёт:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16547
«О, где же добрый доктор?

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16548
Когда же он придёт?»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16549
Но вот, поглядите, какая-то птица

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16550
Всё ближе и ближе по воздуху мчится.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16551
На птице, глядите, сидит Айболит

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16552
И шляпою машет и громко кричит:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16553
«Да здравствует милая Африка!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16554
И рада и счастлива вся детвора:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16555
«Приехал, приехал! Ура! Ура!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16556
А птица над ними кружится,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16557
А птица на землю садится.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16558
И бежит Айболит к бегемотикам,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16559
И хлопает их по животикам,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16560
И всем по порядку

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16561
Даёт шоколадку,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16562
И ставит и ставит им градусники!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16563
И к полосатым

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16564
Бежит он тигрятам.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16565
И к бедным горбатым

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16566
Больным верблюжатам,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16567
И каждого гоголем,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16568
Каждого моголем,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16569
Гоголем-моголем,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16570
Гоголем-моголем,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16571
Гоголем-моголем потчует.

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16572
Десять ночей Айболит

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16573
Не ест, не пьёт и не спит,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16574
Десять ночей подряд

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16575
Он лечит несчастных зверят

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16576
И ставит и ставит им градусники.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16577
Вот и вылечил он их, 
Лимпопо!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16578
Вот и вылечил больных, 
Лимпопо!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16579
И пошли они смеяться,
Лимпопо!


--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16580
И плясать и баловаться, 
Лимпопо!

Добрый доктор Айболит!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16602
Он под деревом сидит.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16603
Приходи к нему лечиться

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16604
И корова, и волчица,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16605
И жучок, и червячок,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16606
И медведица!

#TITLE: 16607
Всех излечит, исцелит

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16608
Добрый доктор Айболит!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16609
И пришла к Айболиту лиса:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16610
«Ой, меня укусила оса!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16611
И пришёл к Айболиту барбос:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16612
«Меня курица клюнула в нос!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16613
И прибежала зайчиха

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16614
И закричала: «Ай, ай!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16615
Мой зайчик попал под трамвай!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16616
Мой зайчик, мой мальчик

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16617
Попал под трамвай!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16618
Он бежал по дорожке,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16619
И ему перерезало ножки,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16620
И теперь он больной и хромой,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16621
Маленький заинька мой!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16622
И сказал Айболит: «Не беда!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16623
Подавай-ка его сюда!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16624
Я пришью ему новые ножки,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16625
Он опять побежит по дорожке».

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16626
И принесли к нему зайку,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16627
Такого больного, хромого,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16628
И доктор пришил ему ножки,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16629
И заинька прыгает снова.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16630
А с ним и зайчиха-мать

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16631
Тоже пошла танцевать,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16632
И смеётся она и кричит:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16633
«Ну, спасибо тебе. Айболит!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16634
Вдруг откуда-то шакал

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16635
На кобыле прискакал:

#TITLE: 16636
«Вот вам телеграмма

«Что такое? Неужели

#TITLE: 16644
«Да-да-да! У них ангина,

Только где же вы живёте?

«Я дальше идти не могу».

И сейчас же с высокой скалы

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16698
К Айболиту слетели орлы:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16699
«Садись, Айболит, верхом,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16700
Мы живо тебя довезём!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16701
И сел на орла Айболит

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16702
И одно только слово твердит:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16703
«Лимпопо, Лимпопо, Лимпопо!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16704
А в Африке,
А в Африке,


--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16705
На чёрной
Лимпопо,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16706
Сидит и плачет
В Африке

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16707
Печальный Гиппопо.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16708
Он в Африке, он в Африке

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16709
Под пальмою сидит

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16710
И на море из Африки

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16711
Без отдыха глядит:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16712
Не едет ли в кораблике

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16713
Доктор Айболит?

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16714
И рыщут по дороге

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16715
Слоны и носороги

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16716
И говорят сердито:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16717
«Что ж нету Айболита?»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16718
А рядом бегемотики

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16719
Схватились за животики:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16720
У них, у бегемотиков,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16721
Животики болят.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16722
И тут же страусята

#TITLE: 16723
Визжат, как поросята.

#TITLE: 16724

Бедных страусят!

И корь, и дифтерит у них,

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16727
И оспа, и бронхит у них,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16728
И голова болит у них,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16729
И горлышко болит.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16730
Они лежат и бредят:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16731
«Ну что же он не едет,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16732
Ну что же он не едет,

Доктор Айболит?»

#TITLE: 16735
Зубастая акула,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16736
Зубастая акула

--- PAGE END ---

#TITLE: 16737
На солнышке лежит.

Ах, у её малюток,

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16739
У бедных акулят,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16740
Уже двенадцать суток

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16741
Зубки болят!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16742
И вывихнуто плечико

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16743
У бедного кузнечика;

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16744
Не прыгает, не скачет он,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16745
А горько-горько плачет он

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16746
И доктора зовёт:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16747
«О, где же добрый доктор?

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16748
Когда же он придёт?»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16749
Но вот, поглядите, какая-то птица

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16750
Всё ближе и ближе по воздуху мчится.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16751
На птице, глядите, сидит Айболит

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16752
И шляпою машет и громко кричит:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16753
«Да здравствует милая Африка!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16754
И рада и счастлива вся детвора:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16755
«Приехал, приехал! Ура! Ура!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16756
А птица над ними кружится,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16757
А птица на землю садится.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16758
И бежит Айболит к бегемотикам,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16759
И хлопает их по животикам,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16760
И всем по порядку

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16761
Даёт шоколадку,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16762
И ставит и ставит им градусники!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16763
И к полосатым

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16764
Бежит он тигрятам.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16765
И к бедным горбатым

#TITLE: 16766
Больным верблюжатам,

#TITLE: 16767
И каждого гоголем,

Каждого моголем,

Гоголем-моголем,

Гоголем-моголем,

Десять ночей Айболит

Десять ночей подряд

#TITLE: 16775

#TITLE: 16776
И ставит и ставит им градусники.

#TITLE: 16777
Вот и вылечил он их, 
Лимпопо!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16778
Вот и вылечил больных, 
Лимпопо!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16779
И пошли они смеяться,
Лимпопо!


--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16780
И плясать и баловаться, 
Лимпопо!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16781
И акула Каракула

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16782
Правым глазом подмигнула

#TITLE: 16783
И хохочет, и хохочет,

#TITLE: 16784
Будто кто её щекочет.

#TITLE: 16801
Добрый доктор Айболит!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16802
Он под деревом сидит.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16803
Приходи к нему лечиться

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16804
И корова, и волчица,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16805
И жучок, и червячок,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16806
И медведица!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16807
Всех излечит, исцелит

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16808
Добрый доктор Айболит!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16809
И пришла к Айболиту лиса:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16810
«Ой, меня укусила оса!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16811
И пришёл к Айболиту барбос:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16812
«Меня курица клюнула в нос!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16813
И прибежала зайчиха

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16814
И закричала: «Ай, ай!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16815
Мой зайчик попал под трамвай!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16816
Мой зайчик, мой мальчик

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16817
Попал под трамвай!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16818
Он бежал по дорожке,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16819
И ему перерезало ножки,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16820
И теперь он больной и хромой,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16821
Маленький заинька мой!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16822
И сказал Айболит: «Не беда!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16823
Подавай-ка его сюда!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16824
Я пришью ему новые ножки,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16825
Он опять побежит по дорожке».

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16826
И принесли к нему зайку,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16827
Такого больного, хромого,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16828
И доктор пришил ему ножки,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16829
И заинька прыгает снова.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16830
А с ним и зайчиха-мать

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16831
Тоже пошла танцевать,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16832
И смеётся она и кричит:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16833
«Ну, спасибо тебе. Айболит!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16834
Вдруг откуда-то шакал

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16835
На кобыле прискакал:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16836
«Вот вам телеграмма

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16837
От Гиппопотама!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16838
«Приезжайте, доктор,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16839
В Африку скорей

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16840
И спасите, доктор,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16841
Наших малышей!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16842
«Что такое? Неужели

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16843
Ваши дети заболели?»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16844
«Да-да-да! У них ангина,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16845
Скарлатина, холерина,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16846
Дифтерит, аппендицит,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16847
Малярия и бронхит!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16848
Приходите же скорее,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16849
Добрый доктор Айболит!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16850
«Ладно, ладно, побегу,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16851
Вашим детям помогу.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16852
Только где же вы живёте?

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16853
На горе или в болоте?»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16854
«Мы живём на Занзибаре,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16855
В Калахари и Сахаре,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16856
На горе Фернандо-По,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16857
Где гуляет Гиппо-по

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16858
По широкой Лимпопо».

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16859
И встал Айболит, побежал Айболит.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16860
По полям, по лесам, по лугам он бежит.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16861
И одно только слово твердит Айболит:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16862
«Лимпопо, Лимпопо, Лимпопо!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16863
А в лицо ему ветер, и снег, и град:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16864
«Эй, Айболит, воротися назад!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16865
И упал Айболит и лежит на снегу:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16866
«Я дальше идти не могу».

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16867
И сейчас же к нему из-за ёлки

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16868
Выбегают мохнатые волки:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16869
«Садись, Айболит, верхом,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16870
Мы живо тебя довезём!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16871
И вперёд поскакал Айболит

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16872
И одно только слово твердит:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16873
«Лимпопо, Лимпопо, Лимпопо!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16874
Но вот перед ними море —

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16875
Бушует, шумит на просторе.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16876
А в море высокая ходит волна.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16877
Сейчас Айболита проглотит она.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16878
«О, если я утону,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16879
Если пойду я ко дну,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16880
Что станется с ними, с больными,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16881
С моими зверями лесными?»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16882
Но тут выплывает кит:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16883
«Садись на меня, Айболит,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16884
И, как большой пароход,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16885
Тебя повезу я вперёд!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16886
И сел на кита Айболит

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16887
И одно только слово твердит:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16888
«Лимпопо, Лимпопо, Лимпопо!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16889
И горы встают перед ним на пути,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16890
И он по горам начинает ползти,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16891
А горы всё выше, а горы всё круче,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16892
А горы уходят под самые тучи!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16893
«О, если я не дойду,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16894
Если в пути пропаду,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16895
Что станется с ними, с больными,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16896
С моими зверями лесными?»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16897
И сейчас же с высокой скалы

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16898
К Айболиту слетели орлы:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16899
«Садись, Айболит, верхом,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16900
Мы живо тебя довезём!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16901
И сел на орла Айболит

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16902
И одно только слово твердит:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16903
«Лимпопо, Лимпопо, Лимпопо!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16904
А в Африке,
А в Африке,


--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16905
На чёрной
Лимпопо,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16906
Сидит и плачет
В Африке

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16907
Печальный Гиппопо.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16908
Он в Африке, он в Африке

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16909
Под пальмою сидит

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16910
И на море из Африки

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16911
Без отдыха глядит:

--- PAGE END ---

#TITLE: 16912
Не едет ли в кораблике

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16913
Доктор Айболит?

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16914
И рыщут по дороге

#TITLE: 16915
Слоны и носороги

И говорят сердито:

Бедных страусят!

И голова болит у них,

#TITLE: 16929
И горлышко болит.

#TITLE: 16930
Они лежат и бредят:

«Ну что же он не едет,

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16932
Ну что же он не едет,

Доктор Айболит?»

А рядом прикорнула

Зубастая акула,

#TITLE: 16936
Зубастая акула

На солнышке лежит.

Ах, у её малюток,

#TITLE: 16939
У бедных акулят,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16940
Уже двенадцать суток

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16941
Зубки болят!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16942
И вывихнуто плечико

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16943
У бедного кузнечика;

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16944
Не прыгает, не скачет он,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16945
А горько-горько плачет он

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16946
И доктора зовёт:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16947
«О, где же добрый доктор?

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16948
Когда же он придёт?»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16949
Но вот, поглядите, какая-то птица

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16950
Всё ближе и ближе по воздуху мчится.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16951
На птице, глядите, сидит Айболит

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16952
И шляпою машет и громко кричит:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16953
«Да здравствует милая Африка!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16954
И рада и счастлива вся детвора:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16955
«Приехал, приехал! Ура! Ура!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16956
А птица над ними кружится,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16957
А птица на землю садится.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16958
И бежит Айболит к бегемотикам,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16959
И хлопает их по животикам,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16960
И всем по порядку

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16961
Даёт шоколадку,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16962
И ставит и ставит им градусники!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16963
И к полосатым

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16964
Бежит он тигрятам.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16965
И к бедным горбатым

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16966
Больным верблюжатам,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16967
И каждого гоголем,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16968
Каждого моголем,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16969
Гоголем-моголем,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16970
Гоголем-моголем,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16971
Гоголем-моголем потчует.

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16972
Десять ночей Айболит

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16973
Не ест, не пьёт и не спит,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16974
Десять ночей подряд

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16975
Он лечит несчастных зверят

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16976
И ставит и ставит им градусники.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16977
Вот и вылечил он их, 
Лимпопо!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16978
Вот и вылечил больных, 
Лимпопо!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16979
И пошли они смеяться,
Лимпопо!


--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16980
И плясать и баловаться, 
Лимпопо!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16981
И акула Каракула

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16982
Правым глазом подмигнула

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16983
И хохочет, и хохочет,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16984
Будто кто её щекочет.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16985
А малютки бегемотики

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 16986
Ухватились за животики

#TITLE: 17001
Добрый доктор Айболит!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17002
Он под деревом сидит.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17003
Приходи к нему лечиться

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17004
И корова, и волчица,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17005
И жучок, и червячок,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17006
И медведица!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17007
Всех излечит, исцелит

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17008
Добрый доктор Айболит!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17009
И пришла к Айболиту лиса:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17010
«Ой, меня укусила оса!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17011
И пришёл к Айболиту барбос:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17012
«Меня курица клюнула в нос!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17013
И прибежала зайчиха

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17014
И закричала: «Ай, ай!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17015
Мой зайчик попал под трамвай!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17016
Мой зайчик, мой мальчик

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17017
Попал под трамвай!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17018
Он бежал по дорожке,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17019
И ему перерезало ножки,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17020
И теперь он больной и хромой,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17021
Маленький заинька мой!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17022
И сказал Айболит: «Не беда!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17023
Подавай-ка его сюда!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17024
Я пришью ему новые ножки,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17025
Он опять побежит по дорожке».

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17026
И принесли к нему зайку,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17027
Такого больного, хромого,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17028
И доктор пришил ему ножки,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17029
И заинька прыгает снова.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17030
А с ним и зайчиха-мать

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17031
Тоже пошла танцевать,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17032
И смеётся она и кричит:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17033
«Ну, спасибо тебе. Айболит!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17034
Вдруг откуда-то шакал

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17035
На кобыле прискакал:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17036
«Вот вам телеграмма

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17037
От Гиппопотама!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17038
«Приезжайте, доктор,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17039
В Африку скорей

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17040
И спасите, доктор,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17041
Наших малышей!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17042
«Что такое? Неужели

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17043
Ваши дети заболели?»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17044
«Да-да-да! У них ангина,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17045
Скарлатина, холерина,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17046
Дифтерит, аппендицит,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17047
Малярия и бронхит!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17048
Приходите же скорее,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17049
Добрый доктор Айболит!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17050
«Ладно, ладно, побегу,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17051
Вашим детям помогу.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17052
Только где же вы живёте?

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17053
На горе или в болоте?»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17054
«Мы живём на Занзибаре,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17055
В Калахари и Сахаре,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17056
На горе Фернандо-По,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17057
Где гуляет Гиппо-по

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17058
По широкой Лимпопо».

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17059
И встал Айболит, побежал Айболит.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17060
По полям, по лесам, по лугам он бежит.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17061
И одно только слово твердит Айболит:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17062
«Лимпопо, Лимпопо, Лимпопо!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17063
А в лицо ему ветер, и снег, и град:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17064
«Эй, Айболит, воротися назад!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17065
И упал Айболит и лежит на снегу:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17066
«Я дальше идти не могу».

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17067
И сейчас же к нему из-за ёлки

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17068
Выбегают мохнатые волки:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17069
«Садись, Айболит, верхом,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17070
Мы живо тебя довезём!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17071
И вперёд поскакал Айболит

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17072
И одно только слово твердит:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17073
«Лимпопо, Лимпопо, Лимпопо!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17074
Но вот перед ними море —

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17075
Бушует, шумит на просторе.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17076
А в море высокая ходит волна.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17077
Сейчас Айболита проглотит она.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17078
«О, если я утону,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17079
Если пойду я ко дну,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17080
Что станется с ними, с больными,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17081
С моими зверями лесными?»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17082
Но тут выплывает кит:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17083
«Садись на меня, Айболит,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17084
И, как большой пароход,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17085
Тебя повезу я вперёд!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17086
И сел на кита Айболит

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17087
И одно только слово твердит:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17088
«Лимпопо, Лимпопо, Лимпопо!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17089
И горы встают перед ним на пути,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17090
И он по горам начинает ползти,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17091
А горы всё выше, а горы всё круче,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17092
А горы уходят под самые тучи!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17093
«О, если я не дойду,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17094
Если в пути пропаду,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17095
Что станется с ними, с больными,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17096
С моими зверями лесными?»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17097
И сейчас же с высокой скалы

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17098
К Айболиту слетели орлы:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17099
«Садись, Айболит, верхом,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17100
Мы живо тебя довезём!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17101
И сел на орла Айболит

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17102
И одно только слово твердит:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17103
«Лимпопо, Лимпопо, Лимпопо!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17104
А в Африке,
А в Африке,


--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17105
На чёрной
Лимпопо,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17106
Сидит и плачет
В Африке

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17107
Печальный Гиппопо.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17108
Он в Африке, он в Африке

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17109
Под пальмою сидит

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17110
И на море из Африки

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17111
Без отдыха глядит:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17112
Не едет ли в кораблике

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17113
Доктор Айболит?

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17114
И рыщут по дороге

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17115
Слоны и носороги

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17116
И говорят сердито:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17117
«Что ж нету Айболита?»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17118
А рядом бегемотики

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17119
Схватились за животики:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17120
У них, у бегемотиков,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17121
Животики болят.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17122
И тут же страусята

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17123
Визжат, как поросята.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17124
Ах, жалко, жалко, жалко

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17125
Бедных страусят!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17126
И корь, и дифтерит у них,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17127
И оспа, и бронхит у них,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17128
И голова болит у них,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17129
И горлышко болит.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17130
Они лежат и бредят:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17131
«Ну что же он не едет,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17132
Ну что же он не едет,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17133
Доктор Айболит?»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17134
А рядом прикорнула

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17135
Зубастая акула,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17136
Зубастая акула

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17137
На солнышке лежит.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17138
Ах, у её малюток,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17139
У бедных акулят,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17140
Уже двенадцать суток

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17141
Зубки болят!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17142
И вывихнуто плечико

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17143
У бедного кузнечика;

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17144
Не прыгает, не скачет он,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17145
А горько-горько плачет он

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17146
И доктора зовёт:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17147
«О, где же добрый доктор?

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17148
Когда же он придёт?»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17149
Но вот, поглядите, какая-то птица

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17150
Всё ближе и ближе по воздуху мчится.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17151
На птице, глядите, сидит Айболит

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17152
И шляпою машет и громко кричит:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17153
«Да здравствует милая Африка!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17154
И рада и счастлива вся детвора:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17155
«Приехал, приехал! Ура! Ура!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17156
А птица над ними кружится,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17157
А птица на землю садится.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17158
И бежит Айболит к бегемотикам,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17159
И хлопает их по животикам,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17160
И всем по порядку

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17161
Даёт шоколадку,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17162

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17163
И к полосатым

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17164
Бежит он тигрятам.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17165
И к бедным горбатым

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17166
Больным верблюжатам,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17167
И каждого гоголем,

--- PAGE END ---

#TITLE: 17168
Каждого моголем,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17169
Гоголем-моголем,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17170
Гоголем-моголем,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17171
Гоголем-моголем потчует.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17172
Десять ночей Айболит

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17173
Не ест, не пьёт и не спит,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17174
Десять ночей подряд

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17175
Он лечит несчастных зверят

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17176
И ставит и ставит им градусники.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17177
Вот и вылечил он их, 
Лимпопо!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17178
Вот и вылечил больных, 
Лимпопо!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17179
И пошли они смеяться,
Лимпопо!


--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17180
И плясать и баловаться, 
Лимпопо!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17181
И акула Каракула

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17182
Правым глазом подмигнула

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17183
И хохочет, и хохочет,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17186
Ухватились за животики

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17187
И смеются, заливаются —

#TITLE: 17188
Так что дубы сотрясаются.

#TITLE: 17201
Добрый доктор Айболит!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17202
Он под деревом сидит.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17203
Приходи к нему лечиться

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17204
И корова, и волчица,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17205
И жучок, и червячок,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17206
И медведица!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17207
Всех излечит, исцелит

И пришла к Айболиту лиса:

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17210
«Ой, меня укусила оса!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17211
И пришёл к Айболиту барбос:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17212
«Меня курица клюнула в нос!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17213
И прибежала зайчиха

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17214
И закричала: «Ай, ай!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17215
Мой зайчик попал под трамвай!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17216
Мой зайчик, мой мальчик

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17217
Попал под трамвай!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17218
Он бежал по дорожке,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17219
И ему перерезало ножки,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17220
И теперь он больной и хромой,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17221
Маленький заинька мой!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17222
И сказал Айболит: «Не беда!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17223
Подавай-ка его сюда!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17224
Я пришью ему новые ножки,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17225
Он опять побежит по дорожке».

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17226
И принесли к нему зайку,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17227
Такого больного, хромого,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17228
И доктор пришил ему ножки,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17229
И заинька прыгает снова.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17230
А с ним и зайчиха-мать

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17231
Тоже пошла танцевать,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17232
И смеётся она и кричит:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17233
«Ну, спасибо тебе. Айболит!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17234
Вдруг откуда-то шакал

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17235
На кобыле прискакал:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17236
«Вот вам телеграмма

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17237
От Гиппопотама!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17238
«Приезжайте, доктор,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17239
В Африку скорей

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17240
И спасите, доктор,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17241
Наших малышей!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17242
«Что такое? Неужели

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17243
Ваши дети заболели?»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17244
«Да-да-да! У них ангина,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17245
Скарлатина, холерина,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17246
Дифтерит, аппендицит,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17247
Малярия и бронхит!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17248
Приходите же скорее,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17249
Добрый доктор Айболит!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17250
«Ладно, ладно, побегу,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17251
Вашим детям помогу.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17252
Только где же вы живёте?

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17253
На горе или в болоте?»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17254
«Мы живём на Занзибаре,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17255
В Калахари и Сахаре,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17256
На горе Фернандо-По,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17257
Где гуляет Гиппо-по

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17258
По широкой Лимпопо».

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17259
И встал Айболит, побежал Айболит.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17260
По полям, по лесам, по лугам он бежит.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17261
И одно только слово твердит Айболит:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17262
«Лимпопо, Лимпопо, Лимпопо!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17263
А в лицо ему ветер, и снег, и град:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17264
«Эй, Айболит, воротися назад!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17265
И упал Айболит и лежит на снегу:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17266
«Я дальше идти не могу».

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17267
И сейчас же к нему из-за ёлки

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17268
Выбегают мохнатые волки:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17269
«Садись, Айболит, верхом,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17270
Мы живо тебя довезём!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17271
И вперёд поскакал Айболит

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17272
И одно только слово твердит:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17273
«Лимпопо, Лимпопо, Лимпопо!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17274
Но вот перед ними море —

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17275
Бушует, шумит на просторе.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17276
А в море высокая ходит волна.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17277
Сейчас Айболита проглотит она.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17278
«О, если я утону,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17279
Если пойду я ко дну,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17280
Что станется с ними, с больными,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17281
С моими зверями лесными?»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17282
Но тут выплывает кит:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17283
«Садись на меня, Айболит,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17284
И, как большой пароход,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17285
Тебя повезу я вперёд!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17286
И сел на кита Айболит

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17287
И одно только слово твердит:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17288
«Лимпопо, Лимпопо, Лимпопо!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17289
И горы встают перед ним на пути,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17290
И он по горам начинает ползти,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17291
А горы всё выше, а горы всё круче,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17292
А горы уходят под самые тучи!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17293
«О, если я не дойду,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17294
Если в пути пропаду,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17295
Что станется с ними, с больными,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17296
С моими зверями лесными?»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17297
И сейчас же с высокой скалы

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17298
К Айболиту слетели орлы:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17299
«Садись, Айболит, верхом,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17300
Мы живо тебя довезём!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17301
И сел на орла Айболит

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17302
И одно только слово твердит:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17303
«Лимпопо, Лимпопо, Лимпопо!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17304
А в Африке,
А в Африке,


--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17305
На чёрной
Лимпопо,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17306
Сидит и плачет
В Африке

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17307
Печальный Гиппопо.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17308
Он в Африке, он в Африке

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17309
Под пальмою сидит

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17310
И на море из Африки

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17311
Без отдыха глядит:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17312
Не едет ли в кораблике

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17313
Доктор Айболит?

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17314
И рыщут по дороге

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17315
Слоны и носороги

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17316
И говорят сердито:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17317
«Что ж нету Айболита?»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17318
А рядом бегемотики

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17319
Схватились за животики:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17320
У них, у бегемотиков,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17321
Животики болят.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17322
И тут же страусята

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17323
Визжат, как поросята.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17324
Ах, жалко, жалко, жалко

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17325
Бедных страусят!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17326
И корь, и дифтерит у них,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17327
И оспа, и бронхит у них,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17328
И голова болит у них,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17329
И горлышко болит.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17330
Они лежат и бредят:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17331
«Ну что же он не едет,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17332
Ну что же он не едет,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17333
Доктор Айболит?»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17334
А рядом прикорнула

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17335
Зубастая акула,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17336
Зубастая акула

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17337
На солнышке лежит.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17338
Ах, у её малюток,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17339
У бедных акулят,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17340
Уже двенадцать суток

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17341
Зубки болят!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17342
И вывихнуто плечико

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17343
У бедного кузнечика;

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17344
Не прыгает, не скачет он,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17345
А горько-горько плачет он

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17346
И доктора зовёт:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17347
«О, где же добрый доктор?

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17348
Когда же он придёт?»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17349
Но вот, поглядите, какая-то птица

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17350
Всё ближе и ближе по воздуху мчится.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17351
На птице, глядите, сидит Айболит

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17352
И шляпою машет и громко кричит:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17353
«Да здравствует милая Африка!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17354
И рада и счастлива вся детвора:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17355
«Приехал, приехал! Ура! Ура!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17356
А птица над ними кружится,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17357
А птица на землю садится.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17358
И бежит Айболит к бегемотикам,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17359
И хлопает их по животикам,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17360
И всем по порядку

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17361
Даёт шоколадку,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17362
И ставит и ставит им градусники!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17363
И к полосатым

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17364
Бежит он тигрятам.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17365
И к бедным горбатым

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17366
Больным верблюжатам,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17367
И каждого гоголем,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17368
Каждого моголем,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17369
Гоголем-моголем,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17370
Гоголем-моголем,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17371
Гоголем-моголем потчует.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17372
Десять ночей Айболит

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17373
Не ест, не пьёт и не спит,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17374
Десять ночей подряд

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17375
Он лечит несчастных зверят

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17376
И ставит и ставит им градусники.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17377
Вот и вылечил он их, 
Лимпопо!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17378
Вот и вылечил больных, 
Лимпопо!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17379
И пошли они смеяться,
Лимпопо!


--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17380
И плясать и баловаться, 
Лимпопо!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17381
И акула Каракула

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17382
Правым глазом подмигнула

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17383
И хохочет, и хохочет,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17384
Будто кто её щекочет.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17385
А малютки бегемотики

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17386
Ухватились за животики

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17387
И смеются, заливаются —

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17388
Так что дубы сотрясаются.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17389
Вот и Гиппо, вот и Попо,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17390
Гиппо-попо, Гиппо-попо!

#TITLE: 17401
Добрый доктор Айболит!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17402
Он под деревом сидит.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17403
Приходи к нему лечиться

#TITLE: 17404
И корова, и волчица,

И сказал Айболит: «Не беда!

#TITLE: 17424

#TITLE: 17425
Он опять побежит по дорожке».

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17426
И принесли к нему зайку,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17427
Такого больного, хромого,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17428
И доктор пришил ему ножки,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17429
И заинька прыгает снова.

#TITLE: 17430
А с ним и зайчиха-мать

Добрый доктор Айболит!»

Вашим детям помогу.

Только где же вы живёте?

На горе или в болоте?»

«Мы живём на Занзибаре,

#TITLE: 17455
В Калахари и Сахаре,

#TITLE: 17456
На горе Фернандо-По,

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17457
Где гуляет Гиппо-по

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17458
По широкой Лимпопо».

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17459
И встал Айболит, побежал Айболит.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17460
По полям, по лесам, по лугам он бежит.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17461
И одно только слово твердит Айболит:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17462
«Лимпопо, Лимпопо, Лимпопо!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17463
А в лицо ему ветер, и снег, и град:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17464
«Эй, Айболит, воротися назад!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17465
И упал Айболит и лежит на снегу:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17466
«Я дальше идти не могу».

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17467
И сейчас же к нему из-за ёлки

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17468
Выбегают мохнатые волки:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17469
«Садись, Айболит, верхом,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17470
Мы живо тебя довезём!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17471
И вперёд поскакал Айболит

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17472
И одно только слово твердит:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17473
«Лимпопо, Лимпопо, Лимпопо!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17474
Но вот перед ними море —

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17475
Бушует, шумит на просторе.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17476
А в море высокая ходит волна.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17477
Сейчас Айболита проглотит она.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17478
«О, если я утону,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17479
Если пойду я ко дну,

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17480
Что станется с ними, с больными,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17481
С моими зверями лесными?»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17482
Но тут выплывает кит:

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17483
«Садись на меня, Айболит,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17484
И, как большой пароход,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17485
Тебя повезу я вперёд!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17486
И сел на кита Айболит

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17487
И одно только слово твердит:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17488
«Лимпопо, Лимпопо, Лимпопо!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17489
И горы встают перед ним на пути,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17490
И он по горам начинает ползти,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17491
А горы всё выше, а горы всё круче,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17492
А горы уходят под самые тучи!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17493
«О, если я не дойду,

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17494
Если в пути пропаду,

Что станется с ними, с больными,

С моими зверями лесными?»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17497
И сейчас же с высокой скалы

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17498
К Айболиту слетели орлы:

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17499
«Садись, Айболит, верхом,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17500
Мы живо тебя довезём!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17501
И сел на орла Айболит

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17502
И одно только слово твердит:

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17503
«Лимпопо, Лимпопо, Лимпопо!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17504

А в Африке,

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17505
На чёрной
Лимпопо,

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17506
Сидит и плачет
В Африке

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17507
Печальный Гиппопо.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17508
Он в Африке, он в Африке

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17509
Под пальмою сидит

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17510
И на море из Африки

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17511
Без отдыха глядит:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17512
Не едет ли в кораблике

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17513
Доктор Айболит?

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17514
И рыщут по дороге

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17515
Слоны и носороги

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17516
И говорят сердито:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17517
«Что ж нету Айболита?»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17518
А рядом бегемотики

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17519
Схватились за животики:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17520
У них, у бегемотиков,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17521
Животики болят.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17522
И тут же страусята

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17523
Визжат, как поросята.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17524
Ах, жалко, жалко, жалко

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17525
Бедных страусят!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17526
И корь, и дифтерит у них,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17527
И оспа, и бронхит у них,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17528
И голова болит у них,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17529
И горлышко болит.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17530
Они лежат и бредят:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17531
«Ну что же он не едет,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17532
Ну что же он не едет,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17533
Доктор Айболит?»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17534
А рядом прикорнула

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17535
Зубастая акула,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17536
Зубастая акула

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17537
На солнышке лежит.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17538
Ах, у её малюток,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17539
У бедных акулят,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17540
Уже двенадцать суток

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17541
Зубки болят!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17542
И вывихнуто плечико

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17543
У бедного кузнечика;

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17544
Не прыгает, не скачет он,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17545
А горько-горько плачет он

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17546
И доктора зовёт:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17547
«О, где же добрый доктор?

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17548
Когда же он придёт?»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17549
Но вот, поглядите, какая-то птица

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17550
Всё ближе и ближе по воздуху мчится.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17551
На птице, глядите, сидит Айболит

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17552
И шляпою машет и громко кричит:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17553
«Да здравствует милая Африка!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17554
И рада и счастлива вся детвора:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17555
«Приехал, приехал! Ура! Ура!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17556
А птица над ними кружится,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17557
А птица на землю садится.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17558
И бежит Айболит к бегемотикам,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17559
И хлопает их по животикам,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17560
И всем по порядку

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17561
Даёт шоколадку,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17562
И ставит и ставит им градусники!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17563
И к полосатым

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17564
Бежит он тигрятам.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17565
И к бедным горбатым

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17566
Больным верблюжатам,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17567
И каждого гоголем,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17568
Каждого моголем,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17569
Гоголем-моголем,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17570
Гоголем-моголем,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17571
Гоголем-моголем потчует.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17572
Десять ночей Айболит

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17573
Не ест, не пьёт и не спит,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17574
Десять ночей подряд

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17575
Он лечит несчастных зверят

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17576
И ставит и ставит им градусники.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17577
Вот и вылечил он их, 
Лимпопо!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17578
Вот и вылечил больных, 
Лимпопо!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17579
И пошли они смеяться,
Лимпопо!


--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17580
И плясать и баловаться, 
Лимпопо!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17581
И акула Каракула

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17582
Правым глазом подмигнула

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17583
И хохочет, и хохочет,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17584
Будто кто её щекочет.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17585
А малютки бегемотики

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17586
Ухватились за животики

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17587
И смеются, заливаются —

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17588
Так что дубы сотрясаются.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17589
Вот и Гиппо, вот и Попо,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17590
Гиппо-попо, Гиппо-попо!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17591
Вот идёт Гиппопотам.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17592
Он идёт от Занзибара.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---

#TITLE: 17601
Добрый доктор Айболит!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17602
Он под деревом сидит.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17603
Приходи к нему лечиться

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17604
И корова, и волчица,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17605
И жучок, и червячок,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17606
И медведица!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17607
Всех излечит, исцелит

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17608
Добрый доктор Айболит!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17609
И пришла к Айболиту лиса:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17610
«Ой, меня укусила оса!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17611
И пришёл к Айболиту барбос:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17612
«Меня курица клюнула в нос!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17613
И прибежала зайчиха

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17614
И закричала: «Ай, ай!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17615
Мой зайчик попал под трамвай!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17616
Мой зайчик, мой мальчик

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17617
Попал под трамвай!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17618
Он бежал по дорожке,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17619
И ему перерезало ножки,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17620
И теперь он больной и хромой,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17621
Маленький заинька мой!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17622
И сказал Айболит: «Не беда!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17623
Подавай-ка его сюда!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17624
Я пришью ему новые ножки,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17625
Он опять побежит по дорожке».

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17626
И принесли к нему зайку,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17627
Такого больного, хромого,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17628
И доктор пришил ему ножки,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17629
И заинька прыгает снова.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17630
А с ним и зайчиха-мать

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17631
Тоже пошла танцевать,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17632
И смеётся она и кричит:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17633
«Ну, спасибо тебе. Айболит!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17634
Вдруг откуда-то шакал

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17635
На кобыле прискакал:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17636
«Вот вам телеграмма

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17637
От Гиппопотама!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17638
«Приезжайте, доктор,

--- PAGE START ---

В Африку скорей

Наших малышей!»

#TITLE: 17642
«Что такое? Неужели

Ваши дети заболели?»

#TITLE: 17644
«Да-да-да! У них ангина,

Дифтерит, аппендицит,

#TITLE: 17647
Малярия и бронхит!

#TITLE: 17648
Приходите же скорее,

#TITLE: 17649
Добрый доктор Айболит!»

#TITLE: 17650
«Ладно, ладно, побегу,

#TITLE: 17651
Вашим детям помогу.

#TITLE: 17652
Только где же вы живёте?

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17653
На горе или в болоте?»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17654
«Мы живём на Занзибаре,

#TITLE: 17657
Где гуляет Гиппо-по

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17658
По широкой Лимпопо».

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17659
И встал Айболит, побежал Айболит.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17660
По полям, по лесам, по лугам он бежит.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17661
И одно только слово твердит Айболит:

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17662
«Лимпопо, Лимпопо, Лимпопо!»

#TITLE: 17663
А в лицо ему ветер, и снег, и град:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17664
«Эй, Айболит, воротися назад!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17665
И упал Айболит и лежит на снегу:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17666
«Я дальше идти не могу».

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17667
И сейчас же к нему из-за ёлки

#TITLE: 17668
Выбегают мохнатые волки:

#TITLE: 17689
И горы встают перед ним на пути,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17690
И он по горам начинает ползти,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17691
А горы всё выше, а горы всё круче,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17692
А горы уходят под самые тучи!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17693
«О, если я не дойду,

#TITLE: 17694
Если в пути пропаду,

#TITLE: 17695
Что станется с ними, с больными,

#TITLE: 17696
С моими зверями лесными?»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17697
И сейчас же с высокой скалы

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17698
К Айболиту слетели орлы:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17699
«Садись, Айболит, верхом,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17700
Мы живо тебя довезём!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17701
И сел на орла Айболит

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17702
И одно только слово твердит:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17703
«Лимпопо, Лимпопо, Лимпопо!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17704
А в Африке,
А в Африке,


--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17705
На чёрной
Лимпопо,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17706
Сидит и плачет
В Африке

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17707
Печальный Гиппопо.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17708
Он в Африке, он в Африке

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17709
Под пальмою сидит

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17710
И на море из Африки

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17711
Без отдыха глядит:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17712
Не едет ли в кораблике

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17713
Доктор Айболит?

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17714
И рыщут по дороге

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17715
Слоны и носороги

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17716
И говорят сердито:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17717
«Что ж нету Айболита?»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17718
А рядом бегемотики

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17719
Схватились за животики:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17720
У них, у бегемотиков,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17721
Животики болят.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17722
И тут же страусята

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17723
Визжат, как поросята.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17724
Ах, жалко, жалко, жалко

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17725
Бедных страусят!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17726
И корь, и дифтерит у них,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17727
И оспа, и бронхит у них,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17728
И голова болит у них,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17729
И горлышко болит.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17730
Они лежат и бредят:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17731
«Ну что же он не едет,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17732
Ну что же он не едет,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17733
Доктор Айболит?»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17734
А рядом прикорнула

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17735
Зубастая акула,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17736
Зубастая акула

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17737
На солнышке лежит.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17738
Ах, у её малюток,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17739
У бедных акулят,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17740
Уже двенадцать суток

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17741
Зубки болят!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17742
И вывихнуто плечико

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17743
У бедного кузнечика;

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17744
Не прыгает, не скачет он,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17745
А горько-горько плачет он

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17746
И доктора зовёт:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17747
«О, где же добрый доктор?

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17748
Когда же он придёт?»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17749
Но вот, поглядите, какая-то птица

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17750
Всё ближе и ближе по воздуху мчится.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17751
На птице, глядите, сидит Айболит

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17752
И шляпою машет и громко кричит:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17753
«Да здравствует милая Африка!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17754
И рада и счастлива вся детвора:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17755
«Приехал, приехал! Ура! Ура!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17756
А птица над ними кружится,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17757
А птица на землю садится.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17758
И бежит Айболит к бегемотикам,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17759
И хлопает их по животикам,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17760
И всем по порядку

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17761
Даёт шоколадку,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17762
И ставит и ставит им градусники!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17763
И к полосатым

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17764
Бежит он тигрятам.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17765
И к бедным горбатым

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17766
Больным верблюжатам,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17767
И каждого гоголем,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17768
Каждого моголем,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17769
Гоголем-моголем,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17770
Гоголем-моголем,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17771
Гоголем-моголем потчует.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17772
Десять ночей Айболит

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17773
Не ест, не пьёт и не спит,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17774
Десять ночей подряд

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17775
Он лечит несчастных зверят

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17776
И ставит и ставит им градусники.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17777
Вот и вылечил он их, 
Лимпопо!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17778
Вот и вылечил больных, 
Лимпопо!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17779
И пошли они смеяться,
Лимпопо!


--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17780
И плясать и баловаться, 
Лимпопо!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17781
И акула Каракула

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17782
Правым глазом подмигнула

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17783
И хохочет, и хохочет,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17784
Будто кто её щекочет.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17785
А малютки бегемотики

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17786
Ухватились за животики

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17787
И смеются, заливаются —

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17788
Так что дубы сотрясаются.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17789
Вот и Гиппо, вот и Попо,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17790
Гиппо-попо, Гиппо-попо!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17791
Вот идёт Гиппопотам.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17792
Он идёт от Занзибара.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17793
Он идёт к Килиманджаро —

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17794
И кричит он, и поёт он:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17795

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17801
Добрый доктор Айболит!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17802
Он под деревом сидит.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17803
Приходи к нему лечиться

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17804
И корова, и волчица,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17805
И жучок, и червячок,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17806
И медведица!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17807
Всех излечит, исцелит

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17808
Добрый доктор Айболит!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17809
И пришла к Айболиту лиса:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17810
«Ой, меня укусила оса!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17811
И пришёл к Айболиту барбос:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17812
«Меня курица клюнула в нос!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17813
И прибежала зайчиха

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17814
И закричала: «Ай, ай!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17815
Мой зайчик попал под трамвай!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17816
Мой зайчик, мой мальчик

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17817
Попал под трамвай!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17818
Он бежал по дорожке,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17819
И ему перерезало ножки,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17820
И теперь он больной и хромой,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17821
Маленький заинька мой!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17822
И сказал Айболит: «Не беда!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17823
Подавай-ка его сюда!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17824
Я пришью ему новые ножки,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17825
Он опять побежит по дорожке».

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17826
И принесли к нему зайку,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17827
Такого больного, хромого,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17828
И доктор пришил ему ножки,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17829
И заинька прыгает снова.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17830
А с ним и зайчиха-мать

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17831
Тоже пошла танцевать,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17832
И смеётся она и кричит:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17833
«Ну, спасибо тебе. Айболит!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17834
Вдруг откуда-то шакал

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17835
На кобыле прискакал:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17836
«Вот вам телеграмма

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17837
От Гиппопотама!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17838
«Приезжайте, доктор,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17839
В Африку скорей

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17840
И спасите, доктор,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17841
Наших малышей!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17842
«Что такое? Неужели

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17843
Ваши дети заболели?»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17844
«Да-да-да! У них ангина,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17845
Скарлатина, холерина,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17846
Дифтерит, аппендицит,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17847
Малярия и бронхит!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17848
Приходите же скорее,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17849
Добрый доктор Айболит!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17850
«Ладно, ладно, побегу,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17851
Вашим детям помогу.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17852
Только где же вы живёте?

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17853
На горе или в болоте?»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17854
«Мы живём на Занзибаре,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17855
В Калахари и Сахаре,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17856
На горе Фернандо-По,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17857
Где гуляет Гиппо-по

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17858
По широкой Лимпопо».

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17859
И встал Айболит, побежал Айболит.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17860
По полям, по лесам, по лугам он бежит.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17861
И одно только слово твердит Айболит:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17862
«Лимпопо, Лимпопо, Лимпопо!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17863
А в лицо ему ветер, и снег, и град:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17864
«Эй, Айболит, воротися назад!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17865
И упал Айболит и лежит на снегу:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17866
«Я дальше идти не могу».

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17867
И сейчас же к нему из-за ёлки

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17868
Выбегают мохнатые волки:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17869
«Садись, Айболит, верхом,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17870
Мы живо тебя довезём!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17871
И вперёд поскакал Айболит

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17872
И одно только слово твердит:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17873
«Лимпопо, Лимпопо, Лимпопо!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17874
Но вот перед ними море —

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17875
Бушует, шумит на просторе.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17876
А в море высокая ходит волна.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17877
Сейчас Айболита проглотит она.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17878
«О, если я утону,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17879
Если пойду я ко дну,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17880
Что станется с ними, с больными,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17881
С моими зверями лесными?»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17882
Но тут выплывает кит:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17883
«Садись на меня, Айболит,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17884
И, как большой пароход,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17885
Тебя повезу я вперёд!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17886
И сел на кита Айболит

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17887
И одно только слово твердит:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17888
«Лимпопо, Лимпопо, Лимпопо!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17889
И горы встают перед ним на пути,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17890
И он по горам начинает ползти,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17891
А горы всё выше, а горы всё круче,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17892
А горы уходят под самые тучи!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17893
«О, если я не дойду,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17894
Если в пути пропаду,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17895
Что станется с ними, с больными,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17896
С моими зверями лесными?»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17897
И сейчас же с высокой скалы

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17898
К Айболиту слетели орлы:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17899
«Садись, Айболит, верхом,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17900
Мы живо тебя довезём!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17901
И сел на орла Айболит

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17902
И одно только слово твердит:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17903
«Лимпопо, Лимпопо, Лимпопо!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17904
А в Африке,
А в Африке,


--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17905
На чёрной
Лимпопо,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17906
Сидит и плачет
В Африке

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17907
Печальный Гиппопо.

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17908
Он в Африке, он в Африке

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17909
Под пальмою сидит

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17910
И на море из Африки

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17911
Без отдыха глядит:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17912
Не едет ли в кораблике

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17913
Доктор Айболит?

#TITLE: 17914
И рыщут по дороге

Слоны и носороги

Животики болят.

И горлышко болит.

Они лежат и бредят:

Доктор Айболит?»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17934
А рядом прикорнула

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17935
Зубастая акула,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17936
Зубастая акула

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17937
На солнышке лежит.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17938
Ах, у её малюток,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17939
У бедных акулят,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17940
Уже двенадцать суток

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17941
Зубки болят!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17942
И вывихнуто плечико

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17943
У бедного кузнечика;

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17944
Не прыгает, не скачет он,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17945
А горько-горько плачет он

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17946
И доктора зовёт:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17947
«О, где же добрый доктор?

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17948
Когда же он придёт?»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17949
Но вот, поглядите, какая-то птица

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17950
Всё ближе и ближе по воздуху мчится.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17951
На птице, глядите, сидит Айболит

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17952
И шляпою машет и громко кричит:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17953
«Да здравствует милая Африка!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17954
И рада и счастлива вся детвора:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17955
«Приехал, приехал! Ура! Ура!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17956
А птица над ними кружится,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17957
А птица на землю садится.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17958
И бежит Айболит к бегемотикам,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17959
И хлопает их по животикам,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17960
И всем по порядку

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17961
Даёт шоколадку,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17962
И ставит и ставит им градусники!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17963
И к полосатым

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17964
Бежит он тигрятам.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17965
И к бедным горбатым

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17966
Больным верблюжатам,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17967
И каждого гоголем,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17968
Каждого моголем,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17969
Гоголем-моголем,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17970
Гоголем-моголем,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17971
Гоголем-моголем потчует.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17972
Десять ночей Айболит

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17973
Не ест, не пьёт и не спит,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17974
Десять ночей подряд

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17975
Он лечит несчастных зверят

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17976
И ставит и ставит им градусники.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17977
Вот и вылечил он их, 
Лимпопо!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17978
Вот и вылечил больных, 
Лимпопо!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17979
И пошли они смеяться,
Лимпопо!


--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17980
И плясать и баловаться, 
Лимпопо!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17981
И акула Каракула

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17982
Правым глазом подмигнула

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17983
И хохочет, и хохочет,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17984
Будто кто её щекочет.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17985
А малютки бегемотики

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17986
Ухватились за животики

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17987
И смеются, заливаются —

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17988
Так что дубы сотрясаются.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17989
Вот и Гиппо, вот и Попо,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17990
Гиппо-попо, Гиппо-попо!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17991
Вот идёт Гиппопотам.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17992
Он идёт от Занзибара.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17993
Он идёт к Килиманджаро —

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17994
И кричит он, и поёт он:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17995
«Слава, слава Айболиту!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 17996
Слава добрым докторам!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18001
Добрый доктор Айболит!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18002
Он под деревом сидит.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18003
Приходи к нему лечиться

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18004
И корова, и волчица,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18005
И жучок, и червячок,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18006
И медведица!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18007
Всех излечит, исцелит

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18008
Добрый доктор Айболит!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18009
И пришла к Айболиту лиса:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18010
«Ой, меня укусила оса!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18011
И пришёл к Айболиту барбос:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18012
«Меня курица клюнула в нос!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18013
И прибежала зайчиха

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18014
И закричала: «Ай, ай!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18015
Мой зайчик попал под трамвай!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18016
Мой зайчик, мой мальчик

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18017
Попал под трамвай!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18018
Он бежал по дорожке,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18019
И ему перерезало ножки,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18020
И теперь он больной и хромой,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18021
Маленький заинька мой!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18022
И сказал Айболит: «Не беда!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18023
Подавай-ка его сюда!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18024
Я пришью ему новые ножки,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18025
Он опять побежит по дорожке».

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18026
И принесли к нему зайку,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18027
Такого больного, хромого,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18028
И доктор пришил ему ножки,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18029
И заинька прыгает снова.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18030
А с ним и зайчиха-мать

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18031
Тоже пошла танцевать,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18032
И смеётся она и кричит:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18033
«Ну, спасибо тебе. Айболит!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18034
Вдруг откуда-то шакал

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18035
На кобыле прискакал:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18036
«Вот вам телеграмма

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18037
От Гиппопотама!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18038
«Приезжайте, доктор,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18039
В Африку скорей

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18040
И спасите, доктор,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18041
Наших малышей!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18042
«Что такое? Неужели

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18043
Ваши дети заболели?»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18044
«Да-да-да! У них ангина,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18045
Скарлатина, холерина,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18046
Дифтерит, аппендицит,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18047
Малярия и бронхит!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18048
Приходите же скорее,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18049
Добрый доктор Айболит!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18050
«Ладно, ладно, побегу,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18051
Вашим детям помогу.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18052
Только где же вы живёте?

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18053
На горе или в болоте?»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18054
«Мы живём на Занзибаре,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18055
В Калахари и Сахаре,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18056
На горе Фернандо-По,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18057
Где гуляет Гиппо-по

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18058
По широкой Лимпопо».

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18059
И встал Айболит, побежал Айболит.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18060
По полям, по лесам, по лугам он бежит.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18061
И одно только слово твердит Айболит:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18062
«Лимпопо, Лимпопо, Лимпопо!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18063
А в лицо ему ветер, и снег, и град:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18064
«Эй, Айболит, воротися назад!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18065
И упал Айболит и лежит на снегу:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18066
«Я дальше идти не могу».

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18067
И сейчас же к нему из-за ёлки

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18068
Выбегают мохнатые волки:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18069
«Садись, Айболит, верхом,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18070
Мы живо тебя довезём!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18071
И вперёд поскакал Айболит

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18072
И одно только слово твердит:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18073
«Лимпопо, Лимпопо, Лимпопо!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18074
Но вот перед ними море —

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18075
Бушует, шумит на просторе.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18076
А в море высокая ходит волна.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18077
Сейчас Айболита проглотит она.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18078
«О, если я утону,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18079
Если пойду я ко дну,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18080
Что станется с ними, с больными,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18081
С моими зверями лесными?»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18082
Но тут выплывает кит:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18083
«Садись на меня, Айболит,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18084
И, как большой пароход,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18085
Тебя повезу я вперёд!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18086
И сел на кита Айболит

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18087
И одно только слово твердит:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18088
«Лимпопо, Лимпопо, Лимпопо!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18089
И горы встают перед ним на пути,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18090
И он по горам начинает ползти,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18091
А горы всё выше, а горы всё круче,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18092
А горы уходят под самые тучи!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18093
«О, если я не дойду,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18094
Если в пути пропаду,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18095
Что станется с ними, с больными,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18096
С моими зверями лесными?»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18097
И сейчас же с высокой скалы

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18098
К Айболиту слетели орлы:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18099
«Садись, Айболит, верхом,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18100
Мы живо тебя довезём!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18101
И сел на орла Айболит

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18102
И одно только слово твердит:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18103
«Лимпопо, Лимпопо, Лимпопо!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18104
А в Африке,
А в Африке,


--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18105
На чёрной
Лимпопо,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18106
Сидит и плачет
В Африке

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18107
Печальный Гиппопо.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18108
Он в Африке, он в Африке

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18109
Под пальмою сидит

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18110
И на море из Африки

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18111
Без отдыха глядит:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18112
Не едет ли в кораблике

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18113
Доктор Айболит?

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18114
И рыщут по дороге

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18115
Слоны и носороги

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18116
И говорят сердито:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18117
«Что ж нету Айболита?»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18118
А рядом бегемотики

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18119
Схватились за животики:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18120
У них, у бегемотиков,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18121
Животики болят.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18122
И тут же страусята

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18123
Визжат, как поросята.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18124
Ах, жалко, жалко, жалко

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18125
Бедных страусят!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18126
И корь, и дифтерит у них,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18127
И оспа, и бронхит у них,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18128
И голова болит у них,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18129
И горлышко болит.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18130
Они лежат и бредят:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18131
«Ну что же он не едет,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18132
Ну что же он не едет,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18133
Доктор Айболит?»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18134
А рядом прикорнула

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18135
Зубастая акула,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18136
Зубастая акула

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18137
На солнышке лежит.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18138
Ах, у её малюток,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18139
У бедных акулят,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18140
Уже двенадцать суток

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18141
Зубки болят!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18142
И вывихнуто плечико

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18143
У бедного кузнечика;

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18144
Не прыгает, не скачет он,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18145
А горько-горько плачет он

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18146
И доктора зовёт:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18147
«О, где же добрый доктор?

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18148
Когда же он придёт?»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18149
Но вот, поглядите, какая-то птица

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18150
Всё ближе и ближе по воздуху мчится.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18151
На птице, глядите, сидит Айболит

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18152
И шляпою машет и громко кричит:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18153
«Да здравствует милая Африка!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18154
И рада и счастлива вся детвора:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18155
«Приехал, приехал! Ура! Ура!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18156
А птица над ними кружится,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18157
А птица на землю садится.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18158
И бежит Айболит к бегемотикам,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18159
И хлопает их по животикам,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18160
И всем по порядку

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18161
Даёт шоколадку,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18162
И ставит и ставит им градусники!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18163
И к полосатым

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18164
Бежит он тигрятам.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18165
И к бедным горбатым

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18166
Больным верблюжатам,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18167
И каждого гоголем,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18168
Каждого моголем,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18169
Гоголем-моголем,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18170
Гоголем-моголем,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18171
Гоголем-моголем потчует.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18172
Десять ночей Айболит

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18173
Не ест, не пьёт и не спит,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18174
Десять ночей подряд

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18175
Он лечит несчастных зверят

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18176
И ставит и ставит им градусники.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18177
Вот и вылечил он их, 
Лимпопо!

--- PAGE END ---

Вот и вылечил больных, 
Лимпопо!

#TITLE: 18179
И пошли они смеяться,
Лимпопо!


--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18180
И плясать и баловаться, 
Лимпопо!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18181
И акула Каракула

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18182
Правым глазом подмигнула

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18183
И хохочет, и хохочет,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18184
Будто кто её щекочет.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18185
А малютки бегемотики

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18186
Ухватились за животики

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18187
И смеются, заливаются —

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18188
Так что дубы сотрясаются.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18189
Вот и Гиппо, вот и Попо,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18190
Гиппо-попо, Гиппо-попо!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18191
Вот идёт Гиппопотам.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18192
Он идёт от Занзибара.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18193
Он идёт к Килиманджаро —

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18194
И кричит он, и поёт он:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18195
«Слава, слава Айболиту!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18196
Слава добрым докторам!»

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18201
Добрый доктор Айболит!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18202
Он под деревом сидит.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18203
Приходи к нему лечиться

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18204
И корова, и волчица,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18205
И жучок, и червячок,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18206
И медведица!

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18207
Всех излечит, исцелит

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18208
Добрый доктор Айболит!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18209
И пришла к Айболиту лиса:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18210
«Ой, меня укусила оса!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18211
И пришёл к Айболиту барбос:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18212
«Меня курица клюнула в нос!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18213
И прибежала зайчиха

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18214
И закричала: «Ай, ай!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18215
Мой зайчик попал под трамвай!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18216
Мой зайчик, мой мальчик

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18217
Попал под трамвай!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18218
Он бежал по дорожке,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18219
И ему перерезало ножки,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18220
И теперь он больной и хромой,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18221
Маленький заинька мой!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18222
И сказал Айболит: «Не беда!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18223
Подавай-ка его сюда!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18224
Я пришью ему новые ножки,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18225
Он опять побежит по дорожке».

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18226
И принесли к нему зайку,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18227
Такого больного, хромого,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18228
И доктор пришил ему ножки,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18229
И заинька прыгает снова.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18230
А с ним и зайчиха-мать

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18231
Тоже пошла танцевать,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18232
И смеётся она и кричит:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18233
«Ну, спасибо тебе. Айболит!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18234
Вдруг откуда-то шакал

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18235
На кобыле прискакал:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18236
«Вот вам телеграмма

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18237
От Гиппопотама!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18238
«Приезжайте, доктор,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18239
В Африку скорей

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18240
И спасите, доктор,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18241
Наших малышей!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18242
«Что такое? Неужели

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18243
Ваши дети заболели?»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18244
«Да-да-да! У них ангина,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18245
Скарлатина, холерина,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18246
Дифтерит, аппендицит,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18247
Малярия и бронхит!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18248
Приходите же скорее,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18249
Добрый доктор Айболит!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18250
«Ладно, ладно, побегу,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18251
Вашим детям помогу.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18252
Только где же вы живёте?

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18253
На горе или в болоте?»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18254
«Мы живём на Занзибаре,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18255
В Калахари и Сахаре,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18256
На горе Фернандо-По,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18257
Где гуляет Гиппо-по

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18258
По широкой Лимпопо».

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18259
И встал Айболит, побежал Айболит.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18260
По полям, по лесам, по лугам он бежит.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18261
И одно только слово твердит Айболит:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18262
«Лимпопо, Лимпопо, Лимпопо!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18263
А в лицо ему ветер, и снег, и град:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18264
«Эй, Айболит, воротися назад!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18265
И упал Айболит и лежит на снегу:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18266
«Я дальше идти не могу».

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18267
И сейчас же к нему из-за ёлки

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18268
Выбегают мохнатые волки:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18269
«Садись, Айболит, верхом,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18270
Мы живо тебя довезём!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18271
И вперёд поскакал Айболит

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18272
И одно только слово твердит:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18273
«Лимпопо, Лимпопо, Лимпопо!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18274
Но вот перед ними море —

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18275
Бушует, шумит на просторе.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18276
А в море высокая ходит волна.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18277
Сейчас Айболита проглотит она.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18278
«О, если я утону,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18279
Если пойду я ко дну,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18280
Что станется с ними, с больными,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18281
С моими зверями лесными?»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18282
Но тут выплывает кит:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18283
«Садись на меня, Айболит,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18284
И, как большой пароход,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18285
Тебя повезу я вперёд!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18286
И сел на кита Айболит

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18287
И одно только слово твердит:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18288
«Лимпопо, Лимпопо, Лимпопо!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18289
И горы встают перед ним на пути,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18290
И он по горам начинает ползти,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18291
А горы всё выше, а горы всё круче,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18292
А горы уходят под самые тучи!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18293
«О, если я не дойду,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18294
Если в пути пропаду,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18295
Что станется с ними, с больными,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18296
С моими зверями лесными?»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18297
И сейчас же с высокой скалы

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18298
К Айболиту слетели орлы:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18299
«Садись, Айболит, верхом,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18300
Мы живо тебя довезём!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18301
И сел на орла Айболит

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18302
И одно только слово твердит:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18303
«Лимпопо, Лимпопо, Лимпопо!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18304
А в Африке,
А в Африке,


--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18305
На чёрной
Лимпопо,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18306
Сидит и плачет
В Африке

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18307
Печальный Гиппопо.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18308
Он в Африке, он в Африке

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18309
Под пальмою сидит

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18310
И на море из Африки

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18311
Без отдыха глядит:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18312
Не едет ли в кораблике

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18313
Доктор Айболит?

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18314
И рыщут по дороге

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18315
Слоны и носороги

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18316
И говорят сердито:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18317
«Что ж нету Айболита?»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18318
А рядом бегемотики

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18319
Схватились за животики:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18320
У них, у бегемотиков,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18321
Животики болят.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18322
И тут же страусята

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18323
Визжат, как поросята.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18324
Ах, жалко, жалко, жалко

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18325
Бедных страусят!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18326
И корь, и дифтерит у них,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18327
И оспа, и бронхит у них,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18328
И голова болит у них,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18329
И горлышко болит.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18330
Они лежат и бредят:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18331
«Ну что же он не едет,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18332
Ну что же он не едет,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18333
Доктор Айболит?»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18334
А рядом прикорнула

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18335
Зубастая акула,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18336
Зубастая акула

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18337
На солнышке лежит.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18338
Ах, у её малюток,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18339
У бедных акулят,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18340
Уже двенадцать суток

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18341
Зубки болят!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18342
И вывихнуто плечико

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18343
У бедного кузнечика;

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18344
Не прыгает, не скачет он,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18345
А горько-горько плачет он

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18346
И доктора зовёт:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18347
«О, где же добрый доктор?

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18348
Когда же он придёт?»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18349
Но вот, поглядите, какая-то птица

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18350
Всё ближе и ближе по воздуху мчится.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18351
На птице, глядите, сидит Айболит

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18352
И шляпою машет и громко кричит:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18353
«Да здравствует милая Африка!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18354
И рада и счастлива вся детвора:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18355
«Приехал, приехал! Ура! Ура!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18356
А птица над ними кружится,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18357
А птица на землю садится.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18358
И бежит Айболит к бегемотикам,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18359
И хлопает их по животикам,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18360
И всем по порядку

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18361
Даёт шоколадку,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18362
И ставит и ставит им градусники!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18363
И к полосатым

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18364
Бежит он тигрятам.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18365
И к бедным горбатым

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18366
Больным верблюжатам,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18367
И каждого гоголем,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18368
Каждого моголем,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18369
Гоголем-моголем,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18370
Гоголем-моголем,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18371
Гоголем-моголем потчует.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18372
Десять ночей Айболит

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18373
Не ест, не пьёт и не спит,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18374
Десять ночей подряд

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18375
Он лечит несчастных зверят

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18376
И ставит и ставит им градусники.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18377
Вот и вылечил он их, 
Лимпопо!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18378
Вот и вылечил больных, 
Лимпопо!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18379
И пошли они смеяться,
Лимпопо!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18380
И плясать и баловаться, 
Лимпопо!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18381
И акула Каракула

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18382
Правым глазом подмигнула

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18383
И хохочет, и хохочет,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18384
Будто кто её щекочет.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18385
А малютки бегемотики

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18386
Ухватились за животики

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18387
И смеются, заливаются —

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18388
Так что дубы сотрясаются.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18389
Вот и Гиппо, вот и Попо,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18390
Гиппо-попо, Гиппо-попо!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18391
Вот идёт Гиппопотам.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18392
Он идёт от Занзибара.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18393
Он идёт к Килиманджаро —

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18394
И кричит он, и поёт он:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18395
«Слава, слава Айболиту!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18396
Слава добрым докторам!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18401
Добрый доктор Айболит!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18402
Он под деревом сидит.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18403
Приходи к нему лечиться

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18404
И корова, и волчица,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18405
И жучок, и червячок,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18406
И медведица!

#TITLE: 18407
Всех излечит, исцелит

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18408
Добрый доктор Айболит!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18409
И пришла к Айболиту лиса:

«Ой, меня укусила оса!»

Мой зайчик попал под трамвай!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18416
Мой зайчик, мой мальчик

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18417
Попал под трамвай!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18418
Он бежал по дорожке,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18419
И ему перерезало ножки,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18420
И теперь он больной и хромой,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18421
Маленький заинька мой!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18422
И сказал Айболит: «Не беда!

--- PAGE END ---

Подавай-ка его сюда!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18424
Я пришью ему новые ножки,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18425
Он опять побежит по дорожке».

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18426
И принесли к нему зайку,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18427
Такого больного, хромого,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18428
И доктор пришил ему ножки,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18429
И заинька прыгает снова.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18430
А с ним и зайчиха-мать

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18431
Тоже пошла танцевать,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18432
И смеётся она и кричит:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18433
«Ну, спасибо тебе. Айболит!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18434
Вдруг откуда-то шакал

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18435
На кобыле прискакал:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18436
«Вот вам телеграмма

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18437
От Гиппопотама!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18438
«Приезжайте, доктор,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18439
В Африку скорей

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18440
И спасите, доктор,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18441
Наших малышей!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18442
«Что такое? Неужели

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18443
Ваши дети заболели?»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18444
«Да-да-да! У них ангина,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18445
Скарлатина, холерина,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18446
Дифтерит, аппендицит,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18447
Малярия и бронхит!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18448
Приходите же скорее,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18449
Добрый доктор Айболит!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18450
«Ладно, ладно, побегу,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18451
Вашим детям помогу.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18452
Только где же вы живёте?

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18453
На горе или в болоте?»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18454
«Мы живём на Занзибаре,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18455
В Калахари и Сахаре,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18456
На горе Фернандо-По,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18457
Где гуляет Гиппо-по

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18458
По широкой Лимпопо».

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18459
И встал Айболит, побежал Айболит.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18460
По полям, по лесам, по лугам он бежит.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18461
И одно только слово твердит Айболит:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18462
«Лимпопо, Лимпопо, Лимпопо!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18463
А в лицо ему ветер, и снег, и град:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18464
«Эй, Айболит, воротися назад!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18465
И упал Айболит и лежит на снегу:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18466
«Я дальше идти не могу».

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18467
И сейчас же к нему из-за ёлки

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18468
Выбегают мохнатые волки:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18469
«Садись, Айболит, верхом,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18470
Мы живо тебя довезём!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18471
И вперёд поскакал Айболит

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18472
И одно только слово твердит:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18473
«Лимпопо, Лимпопо, Лимпопо!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18474
Но вот перед ними море —

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18475
Бушует, шумит на просторе.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18476
А в море высокая ходит волна.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18477
Сейчас Айболита проглотит она.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18478
«О, если я утону,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18479
Если пойду я ко дну,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18480
Что станется с ними, с больными,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18481
С моими зверями лесными?»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18482
Но тут выплывает кит:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18483
«Садись на меня, Айболит,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18484
И, как большой пароход,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18485
Тебя повезу я вперёд!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18486
И сел на кита Айболит

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18487
И одно только слово твердит:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18488
«Лимпопо, Лимпопо, Лимпопо!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18489
И горы встают перед ним на пути,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18490
И он по горам начинает ползти,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18491
А горы всё выше, а горы всё круче,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18492
А горы уходят под самые тучи!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18493
«О, если я не дойду,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18494
Если в пути пропаду,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18495
Что станется с ними, с больными,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18496
С моими зверями лесными?»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18497
И сейчас же с высокой скалы

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18498
К Айболиту слетели орлы:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18499
«Садись, Айболит, верхом,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18500
Мы живо тебя довезём!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18501
И сел на орла Айболит

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18502
И одно только слово твердит:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18503
«Лимпопо, Лимпопо, Лимпопо!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18504
А в Африке,
А в Африке,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18505
На чёрной
Лимпопо,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18506
Сидит и плачет
В Африке

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18507
Печальный Гиппопо.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18508
Он в Африке, он в Африке

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18509
Под пальмою сидит

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18510
И на море из Африки

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18511
Без отдыха глядит:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18512
Не едет ли в кораблике

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18513
Доктор Айболит?

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18514
И рыщут по дороге

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18515
Слоны и носороги

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18516
И говорят сердито:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18517
«Что ж нету Айболита?»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18518
А рядом бегемотики

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18519
Схватились за животики:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18520
У них, у бегемотиков,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18521
Животики болят.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18522
И тут же страусята

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18523
Визжат, как поросята.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18524
Ах, жалко, жалко, жалко

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18525
Бедных страусят!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18526
И корь, и дифтерит у них,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18527
И оспа, и бронхит у них,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18528
И голова болит у них,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18529
И горлышко болит.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18530
Они лежат и бредят:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18531
«Ну что же он не едет,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18532
Ну что же он не едет,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18533
Доктор Айболит?»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18534
А рядом прикорнула

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18535
Зубастая акула,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18536
Зубастая акула

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18537
На солнышке лежит.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18538
Ах, у её малюток,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18539
У бедных акулят,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18540
Уже двенадцать суток

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18541
Зубки болят!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18542
И вывихнуто плечико

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18543
У бедного кузнечика;

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18544
Не прыгает, не скачет он,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18545
А горько-горько плачет он

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18546
И доктора зовёт:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18547
«О, где же добрый доктор?

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18548
Когда же он придёт?»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18549
Но вот, поглядите, какая-то птица

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18550
Всё ближе и ближе по воздуху мчится.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18551
На птице, глядите, сидит Айболит

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18552
И шляпою машет и громко кричит:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18553
«Да здравствует милая Африка!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18554
И рада и счастлива вся детвора:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18555
«Приехал, приехал! Ура! Ура!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18556
А птица над ними кружится,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18557
А птица на землю садится.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18558
И бежит Айболит к бегемотикам,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18559
И хлопает их по животикам,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18560
И всем по порядку

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18561
Даёт шоколадку,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18562
И ставит и ставит им градусники!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18563
И к полосатым

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18564
Бежит он тигрятам.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18565
И к бедным горбатым

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18566
Больным верблюжатам,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18567
И каждого гоголем,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18568
Каждого моголем,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18569
Гоголем-моголем,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18570
Гоголем-моголем,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18571
Гоголем-моголем потчует.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18572
Десять ночей Айболит

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18573
Не ест, не пьёт и не спит,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18574
Десять ночей подряд

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18575
Он лечит несчастных зверят

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18576
И ставит и ставит им градусники.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18577
Вот и вылечил он их, 
Лимпопо!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18578
Вот и вылечил больных, 
Лимпопо!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18579
И пошли они смеяться,
Лимпопо!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18580
И плясать и баловаться, 
Лимпопо!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18581
И акула Каракула

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18582
Правым глазом подмигнула

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18583
И хохочет, и хохочет,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18584
Будто кто её щекочет.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18585
А малютки бегемотики

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18586
Ухватились за животики

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18587
И смеются, заливаются —

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18588
Так что дубы сотрясаются.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18589
Вот и Гиппо, вот и Попо,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18590
Гиппо-попо, Гиппо-попо!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18591
Вот идёт Гиппопотам.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18592
Он идёт от Занзибара.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18593
Он идёт к Килиманджаро —

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18594
И кричит он, и поёт он:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18595
«Слава, слава Айболиту!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18596
Слава добрым докторам!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18597

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18598

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18599

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18600

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18601
Добрый доктор Айболит!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18602
Он под деревом сидит.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18603
Приходи к нему лечиться

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18604
И корова, и волчица,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18605
И жучок, и червячок,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18606
И медведица!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18607
Всех излечит, исцелит

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18608
Добрый доктор Айболит!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18609
И пришла к Айболиту лиса:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18610
«Ой, меня укусила оса!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18611
И пришёл к Айболиту барбос:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18612
«Меня курица клюнула в нос!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18613
И прибежала зайчиха

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18614
И закричала: «Ай, ай!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18615
Мой зайчик попал под трамвай!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18616
Мой зайчик, мой мальчик

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18617
Попал под трамвай!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18618
Он бежал по дорожке,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18619
И ему перерезало ножки,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18620
И теперь он больной и хромой,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18621
Маленький заинька мой!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18622
И сказал Айболит: «Не беда!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18623
Подавай-ка его сюда!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18624
Я пришью ему новые ножки,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18625
Он опять побежит по дорожке».

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18626
И принесли к нему зайку,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18627
Такого больного, хромого,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18628
И доктор пришил ему ножки,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18629
И заинька прыгает снова.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18630
А с ним и зайчиха-мать

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18631
Тоже пошла танцевать,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18632
И смеётся она и кричит:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18633
«Ну, спасибо тебе. Айболит!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18634
Вдруг откуда-то шакал

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18635
На кобыле прискакал:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18636
«Вот вам телеграмма

«Что такое? Неужели

Малярия и бронхит!

#TITLE: 18648
Приходите же скорее,

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18649
Добрый доктор Айболит!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18650
«Ладно, ладно, побегу,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18651
Вашим детям помогу.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18652
Только где же вы живёте?

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18653
На горе или в болоте?»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18654
«Мы живём на Занзибаре,

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18655
В Калахари и Сахаре,

#TITLE: 18656
На горе Фернандо-По,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18657
Где гуляет Гиппо-по

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18658
По широкой Лимпопо».

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18659
И встал Айболит, побежал Айболит.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18660
По полям, по лесам, по лугам он бежит.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18661
И одно только слово твердит Айболит:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18662
«Лимпопо, Лимпопо, Лимпопо!»

#TITLE: 18663
А в лицо ему ветер, и снег, и град:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18664
«Эй, Айболит, воротися назад!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18665
И упал Айболит и лежит на снегу:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18666
«Я дальше идти не могу».

--- PAGE END ---

#TITLE: 18667
И сейчас же к нему из-за ёлки

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18668
Выбегают мохнатые волки:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18669
«Садись, Айболит, верхом,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18670
Мы живо тебя довезём!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18671
И вперёд поскакал Айболит

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18672
И одно только слово твердит:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18673
«Лимпопо, Лимпопо, Лимпопо!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18674
Но вот перед ними море —

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18675
Бушует, шумит на просторе.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18676
А в море высокая ходит волна.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18677
Сейчас Айболита проглотит она.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18678
«О, если я утону,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18679
Если пойду я ко дну,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18680
Что станется с ними, с больными,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18681
С моими зверями лесными?»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18682
Но тут выплывает кит:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18683
«Садись на меня, Айболит,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18684
И, как большой пароход,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18685
Тебя повезу я вперёд!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18686
И сел на кита Айболит

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18687
И одно только слово твердит:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18688
«Лимпопо, Лимпопо, Лимпопо!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18689
И горы встают перед ним на пути,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18690
И он по горам начинает ползти,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18691
А горы всё выше, а горы всё круче,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18692
А горы уходят под самые тучи!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18693
«О, если я не дойду,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18694
Если в пути пропаду,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18695
Что станется с ними, с больными,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18696
С моими зверями лесными?»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18697
И сейчас же с высокой скалы

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18698
К Айболиту слетели орлы:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18699
«Садись, Айболит, верхом,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18700
Мы живо тебя довезём!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18701
И сел на орла Айболит

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18702
И одно только слово твердит:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18703
«Лимпопо, Лимпопо, Лимпопо!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18704
А в Африке,
А в Африке,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18705
На чёрной
Лимпопо,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18706
Сидит и плачет
В Африке

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18707
Печальный Гиппопо.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18708
Он в Африке, он в Африке

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18709
Под пальмою сидит

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18710
И на море из Африки

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18711
Без отдыха глядит:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18712
Не едет ли в кораблике

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18713
Доктор Айболит?

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18714
И рыщут по дороге

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18715
Слоны и носороги

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18716
И говорят сердито:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18717
«Что ж нету Айболита?»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18718
А рядом бегемотики

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18719
Схватились за животики:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18720
У них, у бегемотиков,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18721
Животики болят.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18722
И тут же страусята

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18723
Визжат, как поросята.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18724
Ах, жалко, жалко, жалко

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18725
Бедных страусят!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18726
И корь, и дифтерит у них,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18727
И оспа, и бронхит у них,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18728
И голова болит у них,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18729
И горлышко болит.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18730
Они лежат и бредят:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18731
«Ну что же он не едет,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18732
Ну что же он не едет,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18733
Доктор Айболит?»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18734
А рядом прикорнула

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18735
Зубастая акула,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18736
Зубастая акула

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18737
На солнышке лежит.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18738
Ах, у её малюток,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18739
У бедных акулят,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18740
Уже двенадцать суток

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18741
Зубки болят!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18742
И вывихнуто плечико

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18743
У бедного кузнечика;

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18744
Не прыгает, не скачет он,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18745
А горько-горько плачет он

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18746
И доктора зовёт:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18747
«О, где же добрый доктор?

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18748
Когда же он придёт?»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18749
Но вот, поглядите, какая-то птица

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18750
Всё ближе и ближе по воздуху мчится.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18751
На птице, глядите, сидит Айболит

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18752
И шляпою машет и громко кричит:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18753
«Да здравствует милая Африка!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18754
И рада и счастлива вся детвора:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18755
«Приехал, приехал! Ура! Ура!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18756
А птица над ними кружится,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18757
А птица на землю садится.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18758
И бежит Айболит к бегемотикам,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18759
И хлопает их по животикам,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18760
И всем по порядку

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18761
Даёт шоколадку,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18762
И ставит и ставит им градусники!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18763
И к полосатым

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18764
Бежит он тигрятам.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18765
И к бедным горбатым

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18766
Больным верблюжатам,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18767
И каждого гоголем,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18768
Каждого моголем,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18769
Гоголем-моголем,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18770
Гоголем-моголем,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18771
Гоголем-моголем потчует.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18772
Десять ночей Айболит

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18773
Не ест, не пьёт и не спит,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18774
Десять ночей подряд

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18775
Он лечит несчастных зверят

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18776
И ставит и ставит им градусники.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18777
Вот и вылечил он их, 
Лимпопо!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18778
Вот и вылечил больных, 
Лимпопо!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18779
И пошли они смеяться,
Лимпопо!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18780
И плясать и баловаться, 
Лимпопо!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18781
И акула Каракула

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18782
Правым глазом подмигнула

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18783
И хохочет, и хохочет,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18784
Будто кто её щекочет.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18785
А малютки бегемотики

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18786
Ухватились за животики

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18787
И смеются, заливаются —

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18788
Так что дубы сотрясаются.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18789
Вот и Гиппо, вот и Попо,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18790
Гиппо-попо, Гиппо-попо!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18791
Вот идёт Гиппопотам.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18792
Он идёт от Занзибара.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18793
Он идёт к Килиманджаро —

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18794
И кричит он, и поёт он:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18795
«Слава, слава Айболиту!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18796
Слава добрым докторам!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18797

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18798

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18799

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18800

--- PAGE END ---


--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18801
Добрый доктор Айболит!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18802
Он под деревом сидит.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18803
Приходи к нему лечиться

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18804
И корова, и волчица,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18805
И жучок, и червячок,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18806
И медведица!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18807
Всех излечит, исцелит

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18808
Добрый доктор Айболит!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18809
И пришла к Айболиту лиса:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18810
«Ой, меня укусила оса!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18811
И пришёл к Айболиту барбос:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18812
«Меня курица клюнула в нос!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18813
И прибежала зайчиха

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18814
И закричала: «Ай, ай!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18815
Мой зайчик попал под трамвай!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18816
Мой зайчик, мой мальчик

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18817
Попал под трамвай!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18818
Он бежал по дорожке,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18819
И ему перерезало ножки,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18820
И теперь он больной и хромой,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18821
Маленький заинька мой!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18822
И сказал Айболит: «Не беда!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18823
Подавай-ка его сюда!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18824
Я пришью ему новые ножки,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18825
Он опять побежит по дорожке».

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18826
И принесли к нему зайку,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18827
Такого больного, хромого,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18828
И доктор пришил ему ножки,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18829
И заинька прыгает снова.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18830
А с ним и зайчиха-мать

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18831
Тоже пошла танцевать,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18832
И смеётся она и кричит:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18833
«Ну, спасибо тебе. Айболит!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18834
Вдруг откуда-то шакал

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18835
На кобыле прискакал:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18836
«Вот вам телеграмма

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18837
От Гиппопотама!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18838
«Приезжайте, доктор,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18839
В Африку скорей

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18840
И спасите, доктор,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18841
Наших малышей!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18842
«Что такое? Неужели

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18843
Ваши дети заболели?»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18844
«Да-да-да! У них ангина,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18845
Скарлатина, холерина,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18846
Дифтерит, аппендицит,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18847
Малярия и бронхит!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18848
Приходите же скорее,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18849
Добрый доктор Айболит!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18850
«Ладно, ладно, побегу,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18851
Вашим детям помогу.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18852
Только где же вы живёте?

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18853
На горе или в болоте?»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18854
«Мы живём на Занзибаре,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18855
В Калахари и Сахаре,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18856
На горе Фернандо-По,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18857
Где гуляет Гиппо-по

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18858
По широкой Лимпопо».

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18859
И встал Айболит, побежал Айболит.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18860
По полям, по лесам, по лугам он бежит.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18861
И одно только слово твердит Айболит:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18862
«Лимпопо, Лимпопо, Лимпопо!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18863
А в лицо ему ветер, и снег, и град:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18864
«Эй, Айболит, воротися назад!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18865
И упал Айболит и лежит на снегу:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18866
«Я дальше идти не могу».

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18867
И сейчас же к нему из-за ёлки

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18868
Выбегают мохнатые волки:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18869
«Садись, Айболит, верхом,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18870
Мы живо тебя довезём!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18871
И вперёд поскакал Айболит

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18872
И одно только слово твердит:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18873
«Лимпопо, Лимпопо, Лимпопо!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18874
Но вот перед ними море —

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18875
Бушует, шумит на просторе.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18876
А в море высокая ходит волна.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18877
Сейчас Айболита проглотит она.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18878
«О, если я утону,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18879
Если пойду я ко дну,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18880
Что станется с ними, с больными,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18881
С моими зверями лесными?»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18882
Но тут выплывает кит:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18883
«Садись на меня, Айболит,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18884
И, как большой пароход,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18885
Тебя повезу я вперёд!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18886
И сел на кита Айболит

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18887
И одно только слово твердит:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18888
«Лимпопо, Лимпопо, Лимпопо!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18889
И горы встают перед ним на пути,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18890
И он по горам начинает ползти,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18891
А горы всё выше, а горы всё круче,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18892
А горы уходят под самые тучи!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18893
«О, если я не дойду,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18894
Если в пути пропаду,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18895
Что станется с ними, с больными,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18896
С моими зверями лесными?»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18897
И сейчас же с высокой скалы

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18898
К Айболиту слетели орлы:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18899
«Садись, Айболит, верхом,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18900
Мы живо тебя довезём!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18901
И сел на орла Айболит

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18902
И одно только слово твердит:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18903
«Лимпопо, Лимпопо, Лимпопо!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18904
А в Африке,
А в Африке,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18905
На чёрной
Лимпопо,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18906
Сидит и плачет
В Африке

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18907
Печальный Гиппопо.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18908
Он в Африке, он в Африке

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18909
Под пальмою сидит

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18910
И на море из Африки

#TITLE: 18911
Без отдыха глядит:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18912
Не едет ли в кораблике

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18913
Доктор Айболит?

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18914
И рыщут по дороге

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18915
Слоны и носороги

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18916
И говорят сердито:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18917
«Что ж нету Айболита?»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18918
А рядом бегемотики

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18919
Схватились за животики:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18920
У них, у бегемотиков,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18921
Животики болят.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18922
И тут же страусята

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18923
Визжат, как поросята.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18924
Ах, жалко, жалко, жалко

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18925
Бедных страусят!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18926
И корь, и дифтерит у них,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18927
И оспа, и бронхит у них,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18928
И голова болит у них,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18929
И горлышко болит.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18930
Они лежат и бредят:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18931
«Ну что же он не едет,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18932
Ну что же он не едет,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18933
Доктор Айболит?»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18934
А рядом прикорнула

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18935
Зубастая акула,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18936
Зубастая акула

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18937
На солнышке лежит.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18938
Ах, у её малюток,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18939
У бедных акулят,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18940
Уже двенадцать суток

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18941
Зубки болят!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18942
И вывихнуто плечико

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18943
У бедного кузнечика;

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18944
Не прыгает, не скачет он,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18945
А горько-горько плачет он

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18946
И доктора зовёт:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18947
«О, где же добрый доктор?

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18948
Когда же он придёт?»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18949
Но вот, поглядите, какая-то птица

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18950
Всё ближе и ближе по воздуху мчится.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18951
На птице, глядите, сидит Айболит

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18952
И шляпою машет и громко кричит:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18953
«Да здравствует милая Африка!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18954
И рада и счастлива вся детвора:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18955
«Приехал, приехал! Ура! Ура!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18956
А птица над ними кружится,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18957
А птица на землю садится.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18958
И бежит Айболит к бегемотикам,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18959
И хлопает их по животикам,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18960
И всем по порядку

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18961
Даёт шоколадку,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18962
И ставит и ставит им градусники!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18963
И к полосатым

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18964
Бежит он тигрятам.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18965
И к бедным горбатым

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18966
Больным верблюжатам,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18967
И каждого гоголем,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18968
Каждого моголем,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18969
Гоголем-моголем,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18970
Гоголем-моголем,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18971
Гоголем-моголем потчует.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18972
Десять ночей Айболит

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18973
Не ест, не пьёт и не спит,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18974
Десять ночей подряд

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18975
Он лечит несчастных зверят

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18976
И ставит и ставит им градусники.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18977
Вот и вылечил он их, 
Лимпопо!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18978
Вот и вылечил больных, 
Лимпопо!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18979
И пошли они смеяться,
Лимпопо!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18980
И плясать и баловаться, 
Лимпопо!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18981
И акула Каракула

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18982
Правым глазом подмигнула

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18983
И хохочет, и хохочет,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18984
Будто кто её щекочет.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18985
А малютки бегемотики

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18986
Ухватились за животики

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18987
И смеются, заливаются —

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18988
Так что дубы сотрясаются.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18989
Вот и Гиппо, вот и Попо,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18990
Гиппо-попо, Гиппо-попо!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18991
Вот идёт Гиппопотам.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18992
Он идёт от Занзибара.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18993
Он идёт к Килиманджаро —

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18994
И кричит он, и поёт он:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18995
«Слава, слава Айболиту!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18996
Слава добрым докторам!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18997

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18998

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 18999

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19000

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19001
Добрый доктор Айболит!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19002
Он под деревом сидит.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19003
Приходи к нему лечиться

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19004
И корова, и волчица,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19005
И жучок, и червячок,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19006
И медведица!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19007
Всех излечит, исцелит

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19008
Добрый доктор Айболит!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19009
И пришла к Айболиту лиса:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19010
«Ой, меня укусила оса!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19011
И пришёл к Айболиту барбос:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19012
«Меня курица клюнула в нос!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19013
И прибежала зайчиха

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19014
И закричала: «Ай, ай!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19015
Мой зайчик попал под трамвай!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19016
Мой зайчик, мой мальчик

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19017
Попал под трамвай!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19018
Он бежал по дорожке,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19019
И ему перерезало ножки,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19020
И теперь он больной и хромой,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19021
Маленький заинька мой!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19022
И сказал Айболит: «Не беда!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19023
Подавай-ка его сюда!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19024
Я пришью ему новые ножки,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19025
Он опять побежит по дорожке».

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19026
И принесли к нему зайку,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19027
Такого больного, хромого,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19028
И доктор пришил ему ножки,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19029
И заинька прыгает снова.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19030
А с ним и зайчиха-мать

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19031
Тоже пошла танцевать,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19032
И смеётся она и кричит:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19033
«Ну, спасибо тебе. Айболит!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19034
Вдруг откуда-то шакал

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19035
На кобыле прискакал:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19036
«Вот вам телеграмма

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19037
От Гиппопотама!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19038
«Приезжайте, доктор,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19039
В Африку скорей

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19040
И спасите, доктор,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19041
Наших малышей!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19042
«Что такое? Неужели

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19043
Ваши дети заболели?»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19044
«Да-да-да! У них ангина,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19045
Скарлатина, холерина,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19046
Дифтерит, аппендицит,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19047
Малярия и бронхит!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19048
Приходите же скорее,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19049
Добрый доктор Айболит!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19050
«Ладно, ладно, побегу,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19051
Вашим детям помогу.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19052
Только где же вы живёте?

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19053
На горе или в болоте?»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19054
«Мы живём на Занзибаре,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19055
В Калахари и Сахаре,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19056
На горе Фернандо-По,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19057
Где гуляет Гиппо-по

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19058
По широкой Лимпопо».

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19059
И встал Айболит, побежал Айболит.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19060
По полям, по лесам, по лугам он бежит.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19061
И одно только слово твердит Айболит:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19062
«Лимпопо, Лимпопо, Лимпопо!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19063
А в лицо ему ветер, и снег, и град:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19064
«Эй, Айболит, воротися назад!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19065
И упал Айболит и лежит на снегу:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19066
«Я дальше идти не могу».

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19067
И сейчас же к нему из-за ёлки

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19068
Выбегают мохнатые волки:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19069
«Садись, Айболит, верхом,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19070
Мы живо тебя довезём!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19071
И вперёд поскакал Айболит

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19072
И одно только слово твердит:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19073
«Лимпопо, Лимпопо, Лимпопо!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19074
Но вот перед ними море —

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19075
Бушует, шумит на просторе.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19076
А в море высокая ходит волна.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19077
Сейчас Айболита проглотит она.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19078
«О, если я утону,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19079
Если пойду я ко дну,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19080
Что станется с ними, с больными,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19081
С моими зверями лесными?»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19082
Но тут выплывает кит:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19083
«Садись на меня, Айболит,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19084
И, как большой пароход,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19085
Тебя повезу я вперёд!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19086
И сел на кита Айболит

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19087
И одно только слово твердит:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19088
«Лимпопо, Лимпопо, Лимпопо!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19089
И горы встают перед ним на пути,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19090
И он по горам начинает ползти,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19091
А горы всё выше, а горы всё круче,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19092
А горы уходят под самые тучи!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19093
«О, если я не дойду,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19094
Если в пути пропаду,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19095
Что станется с ними, с больными,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19096
С моими зверями лесными?»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19097
И сейчас же с высокой скалы

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19098
К Айболиту слетели орлы:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19099
«Садись, Айболит, верхом,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19100
Мы живо тебя довезём!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19101
И сел на орла Айболит

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19102
И одно только слово твердит:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19103
«Лимпопо, Лимпопо, Лимпопо!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19104
А в Африке,
А в Африке,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19105
На чёрной
Лимпопо,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19106
Сидит и плачет
В Африке

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19107
Печальный Гиппопо.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19108
Он в Африке, он в Африке

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19109
Под пальмою сидит

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19110
И на море из Африки

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19111
Без отдыха глядит:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19112
Не едет ли в кораблике

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19113
Доктор Айболит?

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19114
И рыщут по дороге

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19115
Слоны и носороги

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19116
И говорят сердито:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19117
«Что ж нету Айболита?»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19118
А рядом бегемотики

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19119
Схватились за животики:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19120
У них, у бегемотиков,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19121
Животики болят.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19122
И тут же страусята

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19123
Визжат, как поросята.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19124
Ах, жалко, жалко, жалко

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19125
Бедных страусят!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19126
И корь, и дифтерит у них,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19127
И оспа, и бронхит у них,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19128
И голова болит у них,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19129
И горлышко болит.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19130
Они лежат и бредят:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19131
«Ну что же он не едет,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19132
Ну что же он не едет,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19133
Доктор Айболит?»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19134
А рядом прикорнула

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19135
Зубастая акула,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19136
Зубастая акула

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19137
На солнышке лежит.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19138
Ах, у её малюток,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19139
У бедных акулят,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19140
Уже двенадцать суток

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19141
Зубки болят!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19142
И вывихнуто плечико

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19143
У бедного кузнечика;

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19144
Не прыгает, не скачет он,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19145
А горько-горько плачет он

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19146
И доктора зовёт:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19147
«О, где же добрый доктор?

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19148
Когда же он придёт?»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19149
Но вот, поглядите, какая-то птица

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19150
Всё ближе и ближе по воздуху мчится.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19151
На птице, глядите, сидит Айболит

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19152
И шляпою машет и громко кричит:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19153
«Да здравствует милая Африка!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19154
И рада и счастлива вся детвора:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19155
«Приехал, приехал! Ура! Ура!»

#TITLE: 19210
«Ой, меня укусила оса!»

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19211
И пришёл к Айболиту барбос:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19212
«Меня курица клюнула в нос!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19213
И прибежала зайчиха

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19214
И закричала: «Ай, ай!

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19215
Мой зайчик попал под трамвай!

Мой зайчик, мой мальчик

#TITLE: 19217
Попал под трамвай!

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19218
Он бежал по дорожке,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19219
И ему перерезало ножки,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19220
И теперь он больной и хромой,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19221
Маленький заинька мой!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19222
И сказал Айболит: «Не беда!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19223
Подавай-ка его сюда!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19224
Я пришью ему новые ножки,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19225
Он опять побежит по дорожке».

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19226
И принесли к нему зайку,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19227
Такого больного, хромого,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19228
И доктор пришил ему ножки,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19229
И заинька прыгает снова.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19230
А с ним и зайчиха-мать

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19231
Тоже пошла танцевать,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19232
И смеётся она и кричит:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19233
«Ну, спасибо тебе. Айболит!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19234
Вдруг откуда-то шакал

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19235
На кобыле прискакал:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19236
«Вот вам телеграмма

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19237
От Гиппопотама!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19238
«Приезжайте, доктор,

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19239
В Африку скорей

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19240
И спасите, доктор,

#TITLE: 19241

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19242
«Что такое? Неужели

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19243
Ваши дети заболели?»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19244
«Да-да-да! У них ангина,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19245
Скарлатина, холерина,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19246
Дифтерит, аппендицит,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19247
Малярия и бронхит!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19248
Приходите же скорее,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19249
Добрый доктор Айболит!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19250
«Ладно, ладно, побегу,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19251
Вашим детям помогу.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19252
Только где же вы живёте?

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19253
На горе или в болоте?»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19254
«Мы живём на Занзибаре,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19255
В Калахари и Сахаре,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19256
На горе Фернандо-По,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19257
Где гуляет Гиппо-по

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19258
По широкой Лимпопо».

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19259
И встал Айболит, побежал Айболит.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19260
По полям, по лесам, по лугам он бежит.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19261
И одно только слово твердит Айболит:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19262
«Лимпопо, Лимпопо, Лимпопо!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19263
А в лицо ему ветер, и снег, и град:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19264
«Эй, Айболит, воротися назад!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19265
И упал Айболит и лежит на снегу:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19266
«Я дальше идти не могу».

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19267
И сейчас же к нему из-за ёлки

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19268
Выбегают мохнатые волки:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19269
«Садись, Айболит, верхом,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19270
Мы живо тебя довезём!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19271
И вперёд поскакал Айболит

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19272
И одно только слово твердит:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19273
«Лимпопо, Лимпопо, Лимпопо!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19274
Но вот перед ними море —

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19275
Бушует, шумит на просторе.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19276
А в море высокая ходит волна.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19277
Сейчас Айболита проглотит она.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19278
«О, если я утону,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19279
Если пойду я ко дну,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19280
Что станется с ними, с больными,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19281
С моими зверями лесными?»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19282
Но тут выплывает кит:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19283
«Садись на меня, Айболит,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19284
И, как большой пароход,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19285
Тебя повезу я вперёд!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19286
И сел на кита Айболит

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19287
И одно только слово твердит:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19288
«Лимпопо, Лимпопо, Лимпопо!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19289
И горы встают перед ним на пути,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19290
И он по горам начинает ползти,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19291
А горы всё выше, а горы всё круче,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19292
А горы уходят под самые тучи!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19293
«О, если я не дойду,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19294
Если в пути пропаду,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19295
Что станется с ними, с больными,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19296
С моими зверями лесными?»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19297
И сейчас же с высокой скалы

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19298
К Айболиту слетели орлы:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19299
«Садись, Айболит, верхом,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19300
Мы живо тебя довезём!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19301
И сел на орла Айболит

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19302
И одно только слово твердит:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19303
«Лимпопо, Лимпопо, Лимпопо!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19304
А в Африке,
А в Африке,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19305
На чёрной
Лимпопо,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19306
Сидит и плачет
В Африке

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19307
Печальный Гиппопо.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19308
Он в Африке, он в Африке

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19309
Под пальмою сидит

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19310
И на море из Африки

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19311
Без отдыха глядит:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19312
Не едет ли в кораблике

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19313
Доктор Айболит?

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19314
И рыщут по дороге

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19315
Слоны и носороги

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19316
И говорят сердито:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19317
«Что ж нету Айболита?»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19318
А рядом бегемотики

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19319
Схватились за животики:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19320
У них, у бегемотиков,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19321
Животики болят.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19322
И тут же страусята

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19323
Визжат, как поросята.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19324
Ах, жалко, жалко, жалко

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19325
Бедных страусят!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19326
И корь, и дифтерит у них,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19327
И оспа, и бронхит у них,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19328
И голова болит у них,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19329
И горлышко болит.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19330
Они лежат и бредят:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19331
«Ну что же он не едет,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19332
Ну что же он не едет,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19333
Доктор Айболит?»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19334
А рядом прикорнула

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19335
Зубастая акула,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19336
Зубастая акула

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19337
На солнышке лежит.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19338
Ах, у её малюток,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19339
У бедных акулят,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19340
Уже двенадцать суток

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19341
Зубки болят!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19342
И вывихнуто плечико

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19343
У бедного кузнечика;

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19344
Не прыгает, не скачет он,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19345
А горько-горько плачет он

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19346
И доктора зовёт:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19347
«О, где же добрый доктор?

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19348
Когда же он придёт?»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19349
Но вот, поглядите, какая-то птица

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19350
Всё ближе и ближе по воздуху мчится.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19351
На птице, глядите, сидит Айболит

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19352
И шляпою машет и громко кричит:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19353
«Да здравствует милая Африка!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19354
И рада и счастлива вся детвора:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19355
«Приехал, приехал! Ура! Ура!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19356
А птица над ними кружится,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19357
А птица на землю садится.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19358
И бежит Айболит к бегемотикам,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19359
И хлопает их по животикам,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19360
И всем по порядку

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19361
Даёт шоколадку,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19362
И ставит и ставит им градусники!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19363
И к полосатым

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19364
Бежит он тигрятам.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19365
И к бедным горбатым

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19366
Больным верблюжатам,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19367
И каждого гоголем,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19368
Каждого моголем,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19369
Гоголем-моголем,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19370
Гоголем-моголем,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19371
Гоголем-моголем потчует.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19372
Десять ночей Айболит

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19373
Не ест, не пьёт и не спит,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19374
Десять ночей подряд

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19375
Он лечит несчастных зверят

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19376
И ставит и ставит им градусники.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19377
Вот и вылечил он их, 
Лимпопо!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19378
Вот и вылечил больных, 
Лимпопо!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19379
И пошли они смеяться,
Лимпопо!

Правым глазом подмигнула

И хохочет, и хохочет,

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19384
Будто кто её щекочет.

#TITLE: 19385
А малютки бегемотики

Ухватились за животики

Вот идёт Гиппопотам.

#TITLE: 19392
Он идёт от Занзибара.

#TITLE: 19393
Он идёт к Килиманджаро —

Добрый доктор Айболит!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19402
Он под деревом сидит.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19403
Приходи к нему лечиться

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19404
И корова, и волчица,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19405
И жучок, и червячок,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19406
И медведица!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19407
Всех излечит, исцелит

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19408
Добрый доктор Айболит!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19409
И пришла к Айболиту лиса:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19410
«Ой, меня укусила оса!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19411
И пришёл к Айболиту барбос:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19412
«Меня курица клюнула в нос!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19413
И прибежала зайчиха

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19414
И закричала: «Ай, ай!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19415
Мой зайчик попал под трамвай!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19416
Мой зайчик, мой мальчик

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19417
Попал под трамвай!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19418
Он бежал по дорожке,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19419
И ему перерезало ножки,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19420
И теперь он больной и хромой,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19421
Маленький заинька мой!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19422
И сказал Айболит: «Не беда!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19423
Подавай-ка его сюда!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19424
Я пришью ему новые ножки,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19425
Он опять побежит по дорожке».

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19426
И принесли к нему зайку,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19427
Такого больного, хромого,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19428
И доктор пришил ему ножки,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19429
И заинька прыгает снова.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19430
А с ним и зайчиха-мать

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19431
Тоже пошла танцевать,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19432
И смеётся она и кричит:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19433
«Ну, спасибо тебе. Айболит!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19434
Вдруг откуда-то шакал

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19435
На кобыле прискакал:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19436
«Вот вам телеграмма

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19437
От Гиппопотама!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19438
«Приезжайте, доктор,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19439
В Африку скорей

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19440
И спасите, доктор,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19441
Наших малышей!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19442
«Что такое? Неужели

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19443
Ваши дети заболели?»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19444
«Да-да-да! У них ангина,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19445
Скарлатина, холерина,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19446
Дифтерит, аппендицит,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19447
Малярия и бронхит!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19448
Приходите же скорее,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19449
Добрый доктор Айболит!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19450
«Ладно, ладно, побегу,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19451
Вашим детям помогу.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19452
Только где же вы живёте?

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19453
На горе или в болоте?»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19454
«Мы живём на Занзибаре,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19455
В Калахари и Сахаре,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19456
На горе Фернандо-По,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19457
Где гуляет Гиппо-по

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19458
По широкой Лимпопо».

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19459
И встал Айболит, побежал Айболит.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19460
По полям, по лесам, по лугам он бежит.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19461
И одно только слово твердит Айболит:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19462
«Лимпопо, Лимпопо, Лимпопо!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19463
А в лицо ему ветер, и снег, и град:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19464
«Эй, Айболит, воротися назад!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19465
И упал Айболит и лежит на снегу:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19466
«Я дальше идти не могу».

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19467
И сейчас же к нему из-за ёлки

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19468
Выбегают мохнатые волки:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19469
«Садись, Айболит, верхом,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19470
Мы живо тебя довезём!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19471
И вперёд поскакал Айболит

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19472
И одно только слово твердит:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19473
«Лимпопо, Лимпопо, Лимпопо!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19474
Но вот перед ними море —

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19475
Бушует, шумит на просторе.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19476
А в море высокая ходит волна.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19477
Сейчас Айболита проглотит она.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19478
«О, если я утону,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19479
Если пойду я ко дну,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19480
Что станется с ними, с больными,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19481
С моими зверями лесными?»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19482
Но тут выплывает кит:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19483
«Садись на меня, Айболит,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19484
И, как большой пароход,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19485
Тебя повезу я вперёд!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19486
И сел на кита Айболит

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19487
И одно только слово твердит:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19488
«Лимпопо, Лимпопо, Лимпопо!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19489
И горы встают перед ним на пути,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19490
И он по горам начинает ползти,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19491
А горы всё выше, а горы всё круче,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19492
А горы уходят под самые тучи!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19493
«О, если я не дойду,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19494
Если в пути пропаду,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19495
Что станется с ними, с больными,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19496
С моими зверями лесными?»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19497
И сейчас же с высокой скалы

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19498
К Айболиту слетели орлы:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19499
«Садись, Айболит, верхом,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19500
Мы живо тебя довезём!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19501
И сел на орла Айболит

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19502
И одно только слово твердит:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19503
«Лимпопо, Лимпопо, Лимпопо!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19504
А в Африке,
А в Африке,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19505
На чёрной
Лимпопо,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19506
Сидит и плачет
В Африке

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19507
Печальный Гиппопо.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19508
Он в Африке, он в Африке

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19509
Под пальмою сидит

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19510
И на море из Африки

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19511
Без отдыха глядит:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19512
Не едет ли в кораблике

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19513
Доктор Айболит?

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19514
И рыщут по дороге

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19515
Слоны и носороги

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19516
И говорят сердито:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19517
«Что ж нету Айболита?»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19518
А рядом бегемотики

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19519
Схватились за животики:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19520
У них, у бегемотиков,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19521
Животики болят.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19522
И тут же страусята

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19523
Визжат, как поросята.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19524
Ах, жалко, жалко, жалко

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19525
Бедных страусят!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19526
И корь, и дифтерит у них,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19527
И оспа, и бронхит у них,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19528
И голова болит у них,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19529
И горлышко болит.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19530
Они лежат и бредят:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19531
«Ну что же он не едет,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19532
Ну что же он не едет,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19533
Доктор Айболит?»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19534
А рядом прикорнула

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19535
Зубастая акула,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19536
Зубастая акула

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19537
На солнышке лежит.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19538
Ах, у её малюток,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19539
У бедных акулят,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19540
Уже двенадцать суток

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19541
Зубки болят!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19542
И вывихнуто плечико

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19543
У бедного кузнечика;

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19544
Не прыгает, не скачет он,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19545
А горько-горько плачет он

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19546
И доктора зовёт:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19547
«О, где же добрый доктор?

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19548
Когда же он придёт?»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19549
Но вот, поглядите, какая-то птица

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19550
Всё ближе и ближе по воздуху мчится.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19551
На птице, глядите, сидит Айболит

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19552
И шляпою машет и громко кричит:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19553
«Да здравствует милая Африка!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19554
И рада и счастлива вся детвора:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19555
«Приехал, приехал! Ура! Ура!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19556
А птица над ними кружится,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19557
А птица на землю садится.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19558
И бежит Айболит к бегемотикам,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19559
И хлопает их по животикам,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19560
И всем по порядку

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19561
Даёт шоколадку,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19562
И ставит и ставит им градусники!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19563
И к полосатым

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19564
Бежит он тигрятам.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19565
И к бедным горбатым

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19566
Больным верблюжатам,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19567
И каждого гоголем,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19568
Каждого моголем,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19569
Гоголем-моголем,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19570
Гоголем-моголем,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19571
Гоголем-моголем потчует.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19572
Десять ночей Айболит

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19573
Не ест, не пьёт и не спит,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19574
Десять ночей подряд

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19575
Он лечит несчастных зверят

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19576
И ставит и ставит им градусники.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19577
Вот и вылечил он их, 
Лимпопо!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19578
Вот и вылечил больных, 
Лимпопо!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19579
И пошли они смеяться,
Лимпопо!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19580
И плясать и баловаться, 
Лимпопо!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19581
И акула Каракула

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19582
Правым глазом подмигнула

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19583
И хохочет, и хохочет,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19584
Будто кто её щекочет.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19585
А малютки бегемотики

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19586
Ухватились за животики

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19587
И смеются, заливаются —

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19588
Так что дубы сотрясаются.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19589
Вот и Гиппо, вот и Попо,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19590
Гиппо-попо, Гиппо-попо!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19591
Вот идёт Гиппопотам.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19592
Он идёт от Занзибара.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19593
Он идёт к Килиманджаро —

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19594
И кричит он, и поёт он:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19595
«Слава, слава Айболиту!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19596
Слава добрым докторам!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19597

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19598

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19599

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19600

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19601
Добрый доктор Айболит!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19602
Он под деревом сидит.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19603
Приходи к нему лечиться

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19604
И корова, и волчица,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19605
И жучок, и червячок,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19606
И медведица!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19607
Всех излечит, исцелит

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19608
Добрый доктор Айболит!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19609
И пришла к Айболиту лиса:

--- PAGE END ---

#TITLE: 19610
«Ой, меня укусила оса!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19614
И закричала: «Ай, ай!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19615
Мой зайчик попал под трамвай!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19616
Мой зайчик, мой мальчик

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19617
Попал под трамвай!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19618
Он бежал по дорожке,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19619
И ему перерезало ножки,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19620
И теперь он больной и хромой,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19621
Маленький заинька мой!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19622
И сказал Айболит: «Не беда!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19623
Подавай-ка его сюда!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19624
Я пришью ему новые ножки,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19625
Он опять побежит по дорожке».

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19626
И принесли к нему зайку,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19627
Такого больного, хромого,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19628
И доктор пришил ему ножки,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19629
И заинька прыгает снова.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19630
А с ним и зайчиха-мать

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19631
Тоже пошла танцевать,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19632
И смеётся она и кричит:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19633
«Ну, спасибо тебе. Айболит!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19634
Вдруг откуда-то шакал

Приходите же скорее,

#TITLE: 19649
Добрый доктор Айболит!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19650
«Ладно, ладно, побегу,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19651
Вашим детям помогу.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19652
Только где же вы живёте?

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19653
На горе или в болоте?»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19654
«Мы живём на Занзибаре,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19655
В Калахари и Сахаре,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19656
На горе Фернандо-По,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19657
Где гуляет Гиппо-по

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19658
По широкой Лимпопо».

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19659
И встал Айболит, побежал Айболит.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19660
По полям, по лесам, по лугам он бежит.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19661
И одно только слово твердит Айболит:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19662
«Лимпопо, Лимпопо, Лимпопо!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19663
А в лицо ему ветер, и снег, и град:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19664
«Эй, Айболит, воротися назад!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19665
И упал Айболит и лежит на снегу:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19666
«Я дальше идти не могу».

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19667
И сейчас же к нему из-за ёлки

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19668
Выбегают мохнатые волки:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19669
«Садись, Айболит, верхом,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19670
Мы живо тебя довезём!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19671
И вперёд поскакал Айболит

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19672
И одно только слово твердит:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19673
«Лимпопо, Лимпопо, Лимпопо!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19674
Но вот перед ними море —

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19675
Бушует, шумит на просторе.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19676
А в море высокая ходит волна.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19677
Сейчас Айболита проглотит она.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19678
«О, если я утону,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19679
Если пойду я ко дну,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19680
Что станется с ними, с больными,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19681
С моими зверями лесными?»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19682
Но тут выплывает кит:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19683
«Садись на меня, Айболит,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19684
И, как большой пароход,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19685
Тебя повезу я вперёд!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19686
И сел на кита Айболит

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19687
И одно только слово твердит:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19688
«Лимпопо, Лимпопо, Лимпопо!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19689
И горы встают перед ним на пути,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19690
И он по горам начинает ползти,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19691
А горы всё выше, а горы всё круче,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19692
А горы уходят под самые тучи!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19693
«О, если я не дойду,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19694
Если в пути пропаду,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19695
Что станется с ними, с больными,

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19696
С моими зверями лесными?»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19697
И сейчас же с высокой скалы

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19698
К Айболиту слетели орлы:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19699
«Садись, Айболит, верхом,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19700
Мы живо тебя довезём!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19701
И сел на орла Айболит

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19702
И одно только слово твердит:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19703
«Лимпопо, Лимпопо, Лимпопо!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19704
А в Африке,
А в Африке,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19705
На чёрной
Лимпопо,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19706
Сидит и плачет
В Африке

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19707
Печальный Гиппопо.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19708
Он в Африке, он в Африке

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19709
Под пальмою сидит

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19710
И на море из Африки

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19711
Без отдыха глядит:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19712
Не едет ли в кораблике

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19713
Доктор Айболит?

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19714
И рыщут по дороге

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19715
Слоны и носороги

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19716
И говорят сердито:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19717
«Что ж нету Айболита?»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19718
А рядом бегемотики

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19719
Схватились за животики:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19720
У них, у бегемотиков,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19721
Животики болят.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19722
И тут же страусята

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19723
Визжат, как поросята.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19724
Ах, жалко, жалко, жалко

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19725
Бедных страусят!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19726
И корь, и дифтерит у них,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19727
И оспа, и бронхит у них,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19728
И голова болит у них,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19729
И горлышко болит.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19730
Они лежат и бредят:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19731
«Ну что же он не едет,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19732
Ну что же он не едет,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19733
Доктор Айболит?»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19734
А рядом прикорнула

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19735
Зубастая акула,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19736
Зубастая акула

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19737
На солнышке лежит.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19738
Ах, у её малюток,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19739
У бедных акулят,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19740
Уже двенадцать суток

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19741
Зубки болят!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19742
И вывихнуто плечико

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19743
У бедного кузнечика;

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19744
Не прыгает, не скачет он,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19745
А горько-горько плачет он

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19746
И доктора зовёт:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19747
«О, где же добрый доктор?

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19748
Когда же он придёт?»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19749
Но вот, поглядите, какая-то птица

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19750
Всё ближе и ближе по воздуху мчится.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19751
На птице, глядите, сидит Айболит

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19752
И шляпою машет и громко кричит:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19753
«Да здравствует милая Африка!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19754
И рада и счастлива вся детвора:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19755
«Приехал, приехал! Ура! Ура!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19756
А птица над ними кружится,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19757
А птица на землю садится.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19758
И бежит Айболит к бегемотикам,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19759
И хлопает их по животикам,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19760
И всем по порядку

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19761
Даёт шоколадку,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19762
И ставит и ставит им градусники!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19763
И к полосатым

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19764
Бежит он тигрятам.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19765
И к бедным горбатым

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19766
Больным верблюжатам,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19767
И каждого гоголем,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19768
Каждого моголем,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19769
Гоголем-моголем,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19770
Гоголем-моголем,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19771
Гоголем-моголем потчует.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19772
Десять ночей Айболит

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19773
Не ест, не пьёт и не спит,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19774
Десять ночей подряд

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19775
Он лечит несчастных зверят

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19776
И ставит и ставит им градусники.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19777
Вот и вылечил он их, 
Лимпопо!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19778
Вот и вылечил больных, 
Лимпопо!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19779
И пошли они смеяться,
Лимпопо!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19780
И плясать и баловаться, 
Лимпопо!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19781
И акула Каракула

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19782
Правым глазом подмигнула

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19783
И хохочет, и хохочет,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19784
Будто кто её щекочет.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19785
А малютки бегемотики

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19786
Ухватились за животики

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19787
И смеются, заливаются —

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19788
Так что дубы сотрясаются.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19789
Вот и Гиппо, вот и Попо,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19790
Гиппо-попо, Гиппо-попо!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19791
Вот идёт Гиппопотам.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19792
Он идёт от Занзибара.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19793
Он идёт к Килиманджаро —

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19794
И кричит он, и поёт он:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19795
«Слава, слава Айболиту!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19796
Слава добрым докторам!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19797

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19801
Добрый доктор Айболит!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19802
Он под деревом сидит.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19803
Приходи к нему лечиться

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19804
И корова, и волчица,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19805
И жучок, и червячок,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19806
И медведица!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19807
Всех излечит, исцелит

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19808
Добрый доктор Айболит!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19809
И пришла к Айболиту лиса:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19810
«Ой, меня укусила оса!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19811
И пришёл к Айболиту барбос:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19812
«Меня курица клюнула в нос!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19813
И прибежала зайчиха

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19814
И закричала: «Ай, ай!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19815
Мой зайчик попал под трамвай!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19816
Мой зайчик, мой мальчик

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19817
Попал под трамвай!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19818
Он бежал по дорожке,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19819
И ему перерезало ножки,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19820
И теперь он больной и хромой,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19821
Маленький заинька мой!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19822
И сказал Айболит: «Не беда!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19823
Подавай-ка его сюда!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19824
Я пришью ему новые ножки,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19825
Он опять побежит по дорожке».

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19826
И принесли к нему зайку,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19827
Такого больного, хромого,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19828
И доктор пришил ему ножки,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19829
И заинька прыгает снова.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19830
А с ним и зайчиха-мать

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19831
Тоже пошла танцевать,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19832
И смеётся она и кричит:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19833
«Ну, спасибо тебе. Айболит!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19834
Вдруг откуда-то шакал

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19835
На кобыле прискакал:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19836
«Вот вам телеграмма

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19837
От Гиппопотама!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19838
«Приезжайте, доктор,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19839
В Африку скорей

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19840
И спасите, доктор,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19841
Наших малышей!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19842
«Что такое? Неужели

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19843
Ваши дети заболели?»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19844
«Да-да-да! У них ангина,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19845
Скарлатина, холерина,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19846
Дифтерит, аппендицит,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19847
Малярия и бронхит!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19848
Приходите же скорее,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19849
Добрый доктор Айболит!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19850
«Ладно, ладно, побегу,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19851
Вашим детям помогу.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19852
Только где же вы живёте?

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19853
На горе или в болоте?»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19854
«Мы живём на Занзибаре,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19855
В Калахари и Сахаре,

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19856
На горе Фернандо-По,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19857
Где гуляет Гиппо-по

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19858
По широкой Лимпопо».

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19859
И встал Айболит, побежал Айболит.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19860
По полям, по лесам, по лугам он бежит.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19861
И одно только слово твердит Айболит:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19862
«Лимпопо, Лимпопо, Лимпопо!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19863
А в лицо ему ветер, и снег, и град:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19864
«Эй, Айболит, воротися назад!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19865
И упал Айболит и лежит на снегу:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19866
«Я дальше идти не могу».

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19867
И сейчас же к нему из-за ёлки

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19868
Выбегают мохнатые волки:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19869
«Садись, Айболит, верхом,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19870
Мы живо тебя довезём!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19871
И вперёд поскакал Айболит

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19872
И одно только слово твердит:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19873
«Лимпопо, Лимпопо, Лимпопо!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19874
Но вот перед ними море —

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19875
Бушует, шумит на просторе.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19876
А в море высокая ходит волна.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19877
Сейчас Айболита проглотит она.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19878
«О, если я утону,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19879
Если пойду я ко дну,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19880
Что станется с ними, с больными,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19881
С моими зверями лесными?»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19882
Но тут выплывает кит:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19883
«Садись на меня, Айболит,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19884
И, как большой пароход,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19885
Тебя повезу я вперёд!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19886
И сел на кита Айболит

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19887
И одно только слово твердит:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19888
«Лимпопо, Лимпопо, Лимпопо!»

И горы встают перед ним на пути,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19890
И он по горам начинает ползти,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19891
А горы всё выше, а горы всё круче,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19892
А горы уходят под самые тучи!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19893
«О, если я не дойду,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19894
Если в пути пропаду,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19895
Что станется с ними, с больными,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19896
С моими зверями лесными?»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19897
И сейчас же с высокой скалы

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19898
К Айболиту слетели орлы:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19899
«Садись, Айболит, верхом,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19900
Мы живо тебя довезём!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19901
И сел на орла Айболит

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19902
И одно только слово твердит:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19903
«Лимпопо, Лимпопо, Лимпопо!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19904
А в Африке,
А в Африке,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19905
На чёрной
Лимпопо,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19906
Сидит и плачет
В Африке

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19907
Печальный Гиппопо.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19908
Он в Африке, он в Африке

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19909
Под пальмою сидит

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19910
И на море из Африки

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19911
Без отдыха глядит:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19912
Не едет ли в кораблике

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19913
Доктор Айболит?

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19914
И рыщут по дороге

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19915
Слоны и носороги

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19916
И говорят сердито:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19917
«Что ж нету Айболита?»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19918
А рядом бегемотики

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19919
Схватились за животики:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19920
У них, у бегемотиков,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19921
Животики болят.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19922
И тут же страусята

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19923
Визжат, как поросята.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19924
Ах, жалко, жалко, жалко

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19925
Бедных страусят!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19926
И корь, и дифтерит у них,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19927
И оспа, и бронхит у них,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19928
И голова болит у них,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19929
И горлышко болит.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19930
Они лежат и бредят:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19931
«Ну что же он не едет,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19932
Ну что же он не едет,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19933
Доктор Айболит?»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19934
А рядом прикорнула

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19935
Зубастая акула,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19936
Зубастая акула

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19937
На солнышке лежит.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19938
Ах, у её малюток,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19939
У бедных акулят,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19940
Уже двенадцать суток

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19941
Зубки болят!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19942
И вывихнуто плечико

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19943
У бедного кузнечика;

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19944
Не прыгает, не скачет он,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19945
А горько-горько плачет он

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19946
И доктора зовёт:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19947
«О, где же добрый доктор?

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19948
Когда же он придёт?»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19949
Но вот, поглядите, какая-то птица

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19950
Всё ближе и ближе по воздуху мчится.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19951
На птице, глядите, сидит Айболит

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19952
И шляпою машет и громко кричит:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19953
«Да здравствует милая Африка!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19954
И рада и счастлива вся детвора:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19955
«Приехал, приехал! Ура! Ура!»

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19956
А птица над ними кружится,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19957
А птица на землю садится.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19958
И бежит Айболит к бегемотикам,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19959
И хлопает их по животикам,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19960
И всем по порядку

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19961
Даёт шоколадку,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19962
И ставит и ставит им градусники!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19963
И к полосатым

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19964
Бежит он тигрятам.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19965
И к бедным горбатым

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19966
Больным верблюжатам,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19967
И каждого гоголем,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19968
Каждого моголем,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19969
Гоголем-моголем,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19970
Гоголем-моголем,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19971
Гоголем-моголем потчует.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19972
Десять ночей Айболит

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19973
Не ест, не пьёт и не спит,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19974
Десять ночей подряд

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19975
Он лечит несчастных зверят

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19976
И ставит и ставит им градусники.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19977
Вот и вылечил он их, 
Лимпопо!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19978
Вот и вылечил больных, 
Лимпопо!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19979
И пошли они смеяться,
Лимпопо!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19980
И плясать и баловаться, 
Лимпопо!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19981
И акула Каракула

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19982
Правым глазом подмигнула

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19983
И хохочет, и хохочет,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19984
Будто кто её щекочет.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19985
А малютки бегемотики

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19986
Ухватились за животики

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19987
И смеются, заливаются —

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19988
Так что дубы сотрясаются.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19989
Вот и Гиппо, вот и Попо,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19990
Гиппо-попо, Гиппо-попо!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19991
Вот идёт Гиппопотам.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19992
Он идёт от Занзибара.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19993
Он идёт к Килиманджаро —

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19994
И кричит он, и поёт он:

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19995
«Слава, слава Айболиту!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 19996
Слава добрым докторам!»

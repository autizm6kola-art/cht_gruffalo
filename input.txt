Гулял мышонок по лесу, и вдруг лиса бежит,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 402
А у лисы, как водится, хороший аппетит.

--- PAGE END ---


--- PAGE START ---

--- PAGE END ---


--- PAGE START ---

--- PAGE START ---

--- PAGE START ---

Он, кстати, очень любит лис. С приправой из петрушки.

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 414

--- PAGE END ---


--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 415

Гулял мышонок по лесу, и вдруг лиса бежит,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 702
А у лисы, как водится, хороший аппетит.

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 703
- Пойдём со мною, маленький, в нору ко мне пойдём,

--- PAGE END ---


--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 704
Мы сможем там отлично позавтракать вдвоём.

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 705
- Простите, тётушка Лиса, - мышонок пропищал,

--- PAGE END ---


--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 706
- Я завтракаю с Груффало: я твёрдо обещал.

--- PAGE END ---


--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 707
- Что там ещё за груффало? Мышонок, ты о ком?

--- PAGE END ---


--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 708
- О, это очень крупный зверь, я с ним давно знаком:

--- PAGE END ---


--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 709
Есть у него клыки, и когти тоже есть,

--- PAGE END ---


--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 710
И преогромнейшая пасть, а в ней зубов не счесть.

--- PAGE END ---


--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 711
- И где же вы встречаетесь?

--- PAGE END ---


--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 712
- Да вон у той горушки.

--- PAGE END ---


--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 713
Он, кстати, очень любит лис. С приправой из петрушки.

--- PAGE END ---


--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 714
- С приправой, говоришь? Ну, мне пора домой.

--- PAGE END ---


--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 715
Прощай, мышонок! – и лиса нырнула в лес густой.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---

Гулял мышонок по лесу, и вдруг сова летит,

--- PAGE END ---


--- PAGE START ---

#TITLE: 720
- Летим со мною, лёгонький, летим ко мне в дупло,

--- PAGE END ---

#TITLE: 721
Там стол обеденный накрыт, там сухо и тепло.

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 726

--- PAGE END ---

#TITLE: 727
И бородавка на носу, а в бородавке – яд!

--- PAGE END ---


--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 728
- А где вы с ним встречаетесь?

--- PAGE END ---


--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 729
- Вон там, за ручейком.

--- PAGE END ---


--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 730
Он, кстати, очень любит сов. Тушёных, с чесноком.

--- PAGE END ---


--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 1508
- О, это очень крупный зверь, я с ним давно знаком:

--- PAGE END ---


--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 1509
Есть у него клыки, и когти тоже есть,

--- PAGE END ---


--- PAGE START ---

И преогромнейшая пасть, а в ней зубов не счесть.

--- PAGE START ---

--- PAGE END ---


--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 1543
Глаза огнём горят, язык черней черники,

--- PAGE END ---


--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 1544
В шипах лиловых вся спина, и вид ужасно дикий!

--- PAGE END ---


--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 1545
- А где вы с ним встречаетесь?

--- PAGE END ---


--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 1546

#TITLE: 1561
Я положу тебя на хлеб, и выйдет бутерброд.

--- PAGE END ---


--- PAGE START ---

Я самый страшный зверь лесной, я всех тут застращал!

А ну, пошли со мною, сейчас увидишь ты,

Ты топай впереди, а я тихонько сзади.

Там сможем мы отлично поужинать с тобой.

- Простите, госпожа Змея, - мышонок пропищал, -

#TITLE: 1740
Я с Груффало поужинать сегодня обещал.

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 1741
- Што-што? Какое груффало? Мышонок, ты о ком?

--- PAGE END ---


--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 1742
- О, это очень крупный зверь, я с ним давно знаком:

--- PAGE END ---


--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 1743
Глаза огнём горят, язык черней черники,

--- PAGE END ---


--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 1744
В шипах лиловых вся спина, и вид ужасно дикий!

--- PAGE END ---


--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 1745
- А где вы с ним встречаетесь?

--- PAGE END ---


--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 1746
- Тут рядом, на пруду.
--- PAGE END ---


--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 1747
Он, кстати, очень любит змей. В сметане и в меду.

--- PAGE END ---


--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 1748
- В сметане, говоришь? Ну, мне пора в постель.

--- PAGE END ---


--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 1749
Прощай, мышонок! – и змея в свою скользнула щель.

--- PAGE END ---


--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 1750
- Ха, глупая змея, не знает ничего!

--- PAGE END ---


--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 1751
Спасибо, выдумка моя, спасибо, груффа……Ой!

--- PAGE END ---


--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 1752
Как этот страшный зверь сумел сюда попасть?

--- PAGE END ---



--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 1753
Какие острые клыки, чудовищная пасть!

--- PAGE END ---



--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 1754
Ножищи, как столбы… на них когтищи в ряд…

--- PAGE END ---


--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 1755
И бородавка на носу, а в бородавке – яд!

--- PAGE END ---


--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 1756
Глаза горят огнём, язык черней черники,

В шипах лиловых вся спина, и вид ужасно дикий.

Ой мама, это груффало!

--- PAGE END ---


--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 1759
Оно меня понюфало!

--- PAGE END ---


--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 1760
- Еда, - воскликнул Груффало, - сама шагает в рот!

--- PAGE END ---


--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 1761
Я положу тебя на хлеб, и выйдет бутерброд.

--- PAGE END ---


--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 1762
- Меня на хлеб? Да я такой… - мышонок пропищал, -

--- PAGE END ---


--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 1763
Я самый страшный зверь лесной, я всех тут застращал!

--- PAGE END ---


--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 1764
А ну, пошли со мною, сейчас увидишь ты,

--- PAGE END ---


--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 1765
Как от меня все звери бросаются в кусты!

--- PAGE END ---


--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 1766
- Ну что ж… ха-ха… веди! Взгляну, потехи ради.

--- PAGE END ---


--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 1767
Ты топай впереди, а я тихонько сзади.

--- PAGE END ---


--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 1768
Вот по лесу они вдвоём шагают не спеша,

--- PAGE END ---


--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 1769
И вдруг шипенье слышится и шорох камыша.

--- PAGE END ---


--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 1770
- Да это же Змея! – мышонок закричал. –

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 1771
Привет, не виделись сто лет, я даже заскучал!

--- PAGE END ---


--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 1772
Змея сказала: «Мамочки! На помощь! Караул!»,

--- PAGE END ---


--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 1773
Под кучу брёвен заползла – и только хвост мелькнул.

--- PAGE END ---


--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 1774
- Ну как? – спросил мышонок, - что скажешь ты теперь?

--- PAGE END ---


--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 1775
- Да, это удивительно, - промолвил страшный зверь.

--- PAGE END ---


--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 1776
Вот через лес они опять шагают друг за дружкой,

--- PAGE END ---


--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 1777
И вдруг заухало в ветвях над самою опушкой.

--- PAGE END ---


--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 1808
- О, это очень крупный зверь, я с ним давно знаком:

--- PAGE END ---


--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 1809
Есть у него клыки, и когти тоже есть,

--- PAGE END ---


--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 1810
И преогромнейшая пасть, а в ней зубов не счесть.

--- PAGE END ---


--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 1812
- Да вон у той горушки.

Он, кстати, очень любит лис. С приправой из петрушки.

#TITLE: 1814

#TITLE: 1819
А у совы, как водится, отменный аппетит.

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 1820
- Летим со мною, лёгонький, летим ко мне в дупло,

--- PAGE END ---


--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 1821
Там стол обеденный накрыт, там сухо и тепло.

Он, кстати, очень любит сов. Тушёных, с чесноком.

#TITLE: 1831
Тушёных, говоришь? Ну, я спешу… дела…

А ну, пошли со мною, сейчас увидишь ты,

Как от меня все звери бросаются в кусты!

- Ну что ж… ха-ха… веди! Взгляну, потехи ради.

Ты топай впереди, а я тихонько сзади.

Змея сказала: «Мамочки! На помощь! Караул!»,

Под кучу брёвен заползла – и только хвост мелькнул.

#TITLE: 1974
- Ну как? – спросил мышонок, - что скажешь ты теперь?

--- PAGE END ---


--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 1975
- Да, это удивительно, - промолвил страшный зверь.

Вот через лес они опять шагают друг за дружкой,

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 2008
- О, это очень крупный зверь, я с ним давно знаком:

--- PAGE END ---


--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 2009
Есть у него клыки, и когти тоже есть,

--- PAGE END ---


--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 2010
И преогромнейшая пасть, а в ней зубов не счесть.

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 2012

Он, кстати, очень любит лис. С приправой из петрушки.

В шипах лиловых вся спина, и вид ужасно дикий!

Забилась в тёмное дупло и больше ни гу-гу.

#TITLE: 2182
- Ну как? – спросил мышонок, - что скажешь ты теперь?

--- PAGE END ---


--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 2183
- Да, это поразительно! - воскликнул страшный зверь.

--- PAGE END ---


--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 2184
И вот опять они вдвоём идут лесной тропинкой.

--- PAGE END ---


--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 2185
Что там за рыжее пятно мелькнуло за осинкой?

--- PAGE END ---


--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 2186
- Эй, тётушка Лиса! – мышонок закричал. –

--- PAGE END ---


--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 2187
Ты что же в гости не идёшь, я даже осерчал.

--- PAGE END ---


--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 2188
Лиса сказала: «Это он! Спасите… Нету сил…»,

--- PAGE END ---


--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 2189
И мигом юркнула в нору, и след её простыл.

--- PAGE END ---


--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 2190
- Ну вот, – сказал мышонок, - не правда ли, теперь

--- PAGE END ---


--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 2191
Ты убедился, что в лесу я самый страшный зверь?

--- PAGE END ---


--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 2192
Но я проголодался… Эх, что ни говори,

--- PAGE END ---


--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 2193
Всего вкуснее груффало с орешками внутри!

Гулял мышонок по лесу, и вдруг лиса бежит,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 2202
А у лисы, как водится, хороший аппетит.

--- PAGE END ---


--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 2203
- Пойдём со мною, маленький, в нору ко мне пойдём,

--- PAGE END ---


--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 2204
Мы сможем там отлично позавтракать вдвоём.

--- PAGE END ---


--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 2205
- Простите, тётушка Лиса, - мышонок пропищал,

--- PAGE END ---


--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 2206
- Я завтракаю с Груффало: я твёрдо обещал.

--- PAGE END ---


--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 2207
- Что там ещё за груффало? Мышонок, ты о ком?

--- PAGE END ---


--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 2208
- О, это очень крупный зверь, я с ним давно знаком:

--- PAGE END ---


--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 2209
Есть у него клыки, и когти тоже есть,

--- PAGE END ---


--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 2210
И преогромнейшая пасть, а в ней зубов не счесть.

--- PAGE END ---


--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 2211
- И где же вы встречаетесь?

--- PAGE END ---


--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 2212
- Да вон у той горушки.

--- PAGE END ---


--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 2213
Он, кстати, очень любит лис. С приправой из петрушки.

--- PAGE END ---


--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 2214
- С приправой, говоришь? Ну, мне пора домой.

--- PAGE END ---


--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 2215
Прощай, мышонок! – и лиса нырнула в лес густой.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 2216
- Ха, глупая лиса! Не знает ничего!

--- PAGE END ---


--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 2217
Нет никакого груффало, я выдумал его.

--- PAGE END ---


--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 2218
Гулял мышонок по лесу, и вдруг сова летит,

--- PAGE END ---


--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 2219
А у совы, как водится, отменный аппетит.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 2220
- Летим со мною, лёгонький, летим ко мне в дупло,

--- PAGE END ---


--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 2221
Там стол обеденный накрыт, там сухо и тепло.

--- PAGE END ---


--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 2222
- Простите, бабушка Сова, - мышонок пропищал, - 

--- PAGE END ---


--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 2223
Я пообедать с Груффало сегодня обещал.

--- PAGE END ---


--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 2224
- Какое ещё груффало? Мышонок, ты о ком?

--- PAGE END ---


--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 2225
- О, это очень крупный зверь, я с ним давно знаком:

--- PAGE END ---


--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 2226
Ножищи, как столбы! На них когтищи в ряд!

--- PAGE END ---


--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 2227
И бородавка на носу, а в бородавке – яд!

--- PAGE END ---


--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 2228
- А где вы с ним встречаетесь?

--- PAGE END ---


--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 2229
- Вон там, за ручейком.

--- PAGE END ---


--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 2230
Он, кстати, очень любит сов. Тушёных, с чесноком.

--- PAGE END ---


--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 2231
Тушёных, говоришь? Ну, я спешу… дела…

--- PAGE END ---


--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 2232
Прощай, мышонок! – и сова умчалась как стрела.

А у змеи, как водится, прекрасный аппетит.

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 2237

--- PAGE END ---


--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 2238
Там сможем мы отлично поужинать с тобой.

#TITLE: 2239
- Простите, госпожа Змея, - мышонок пропищал, -

#TITLE: 2240
Я с Груффало поужинать сегодня обещал.

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 2241
- Што-што? Какое груффало? Мышонок, ты о ком?

--- PAGE END ---


--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 2242
- О, это очень крупный зверь, я с ним давно знаком:

--- PAGE END ---


--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 2243
Глаза огнём горят, язык черней черники,

--- PAGE END ---


--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 2244
В шипах лиловых вся спина, и вид ужасно дикий!

--- PAGE END ---


--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 2245
- А где вы с ним встречаетесь?

--- PAGE END ---


--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 2246
- Тут рядом, на пруду.
--- PAGE END ---


--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 2247
Он, кстати, очень любит змей. В сметане и в меду.

--- PAGE END ---


--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 2248
- В сметане, говоришь? Ну, мне пора в постель.

--- PAGE END ---


--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 2249
Прощай, мышонок! – и змея в свою скользнула щель.

--- PAGE END ---

#TITLE: 2250
- Ха, глупая змея, не знает ничего!

--- PAGE END ---


--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 2251
Спасибо, выдумка моя, спасибо, груффа……Ой!

--- PAGE END ---


--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 2252
Как этот страшный зверь сумел сюда попасть?

--- PAGE END ---



--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 2253
Какие острые клыки, чудовищная пасть!

--- PAGE END ---



--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 2254
Ножищи, как столбы… на них когтищи в ряд…

--- PAGE END ---


--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 2255
И бородавка на носу, а в бородавке – яд!

--- PAGE END ---


--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 2256

--- PAGE END ---


--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 2258
Ой мама, это груффало!

--- PAGE END ---


--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 2259
Оно меня понюфало!

--- PAGE END ---


--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 2260
- Еда, - воскликнул Груффало, - сама шагает в рот!

--- PAGE END ---


--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 2261
Я положу тебя на хлеб, и выйдет бутерброд.

--- PAGE END ---


--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 2262
- Меня на хлеб? Да я такой… - мышонок пропищал, -

--- PAGE END ---


--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 2263
Я самый страшный зверь лесной, я всех тут застращал!

--- PAGE END ---


--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 2264
А ну, пошли со мною, сейчас увидишь ты,

--- PAGE END ---


--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 2265
Как от меня все звери бросаются в кусты!

--- PAGE END ---


--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 2266
- Ну что ж… ха-ха… веди! Взгляну, потехи ради.

--- PAGE END ---


--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 2267
Ты топай впереди, а я тихонько сзади.

--- PAGE END ---


--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 2268
Вот по лесу они вдвоём шагают не спеша,

--- PAGE END ---


--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 2269
И вдруг шипенье слышится и шорох камыша.

--- PAGE END ---


--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 2270
- Да это же Змея! – мышонок закричал. –

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 2271
Привет, не виделись сто лет, я даже заскучал!

--- PAGE END ---


--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 2272
Змея сказала: «Мамочки! На помощь! Караул!»,

--- PAGE END ---


--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 2273
Под кучу брёвен заползла – и только хвост мелькнул.

--- PAGE END ---


--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 2274
- Ну как? – спросил мышонок, - что скажешь ты теперь?

--- PAGE END ---


--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 2275
- Да, это удивительно, - промолвил страшный зверь.

--- PAGE END ---


--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 2276
Вот через лес они опять шагают друг за дружкой,

--- PAGE END ---


--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 2277
И вдруг заухало в ветвях над самою опушкой.

--- PAGE END ---


--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 2278
- Да это же Сова! – мышонок закричал. –

--- PAGE END ---


--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 2279
Здорово, бабушка, давно тебя я не встречал!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 2280
Сова сказала: «Батюшки! Спасите… Не могу…»,

--- PAGE END ---


--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 2281
Забилась в тёмное дупло и больше ни гу-гу.

#TITLE: 2294
- С орешками внутри? Да это страшный сон!

--- PAGE END ---


--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 2295
И зверь пустился наутёк, и в чаще скрылся он.

--- PAGE END ---


--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 2296
Сидит мышонок на пеньке, орешками хрустит:

--- PAGE END ---


--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 2297
Ведь он сегодня нагулял отличный аппетит.

Всего вкуснее груффало с орешками внутри!

--- PAGE END ---


--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 2394
- С орешками внутри? Да это страшный сон!

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 2395
И зверь пустился наутёк, и в чаще скрылся он.

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 2396
Сидит мышонок на пеньке, орешками хрустит:

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 2397
Ведь он сегодня нагулял отличный аппетит.

Гулял мышонок по лесу, и вдруг лиса бежит,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 2402
А у лисы, как водится, хороший аппетит.

--- PAGE END ---


--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 2403
- Пойдём со мною, маленький, в нору ко мне пойдём,

--- PAGE END ---


--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 2404
Мы сможем там отлично позавтракать вдвоём.

--- PAGE END ---


--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 2405
- Простите, тётушка Лиса, - мышонок пропищал,

--- PAGE END ---


--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 2406
- Я завтракаю с Груффало: я твёрдо обещал.

--- PAGE END ---


--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 2407
- Что там ещё за груффало? Мышонок, ты о ком?

--- PAGE END ---


--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 2408
- О, это очень крупный зверь, я с ним давно знаком:

--- PAGE END ---


--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 2409
Есть у него клыки, и когти тоже есть,

--- PAGE END ---


--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 2410
И преогромнейшая пасть, а в ней зубов не счесть.

--- PAGE END ---


--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 2411
- И где же вы встречаетесь?

--- PAGE END ---


--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 2412
- Да вон у той горушки.

--- PAGE END ---


--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 2413
Он, кстати, очень любит лис. С приправой из петрушки.

--- PAGE END ---


--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 2414
- С приправой, говоришь? Ну, мне пора домой.

--- PAGE END ---


--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 2415
Прощай, мышонок! – и лиса нырнула в лес густой.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 2416
- Ха, глупая лиса! Не знает ничего!

--- PAGE END ---


--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 2417
Нет никакого груффало, я выдумал его.

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 2418
Гулял мышонок по лесу, и вдруг сова летит,

--- PAGE END ---


--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 2419
А у совы, как водится, отменный аппетит.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 2420
- Летим со мною, лёгонький, летим ко мне в дупло,

--- PAGE END ---


--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 2421
Там стол обеденный накрыт, там сухо и тепло.

--- PAGE END ---


--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 2422

--- PAGE END ---


--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 2423
Я пообедать с Груффало сегодня обещал.

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 2424
- Какое ещё груффало? Мышонок, ты о ком?

--- PAGE END ---


--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 2425
- О, это очень крупный зверь, я с ним давно знаком:

--- PAGE END ---


--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 2426
Ножищи, как столбы! На них когтищи в ряд!

--- PAGE END ---


--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 2427
И бородавка на носу, а в бородавке – яд!

--- PAGE END ---


--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 2428
- А где вы с ним встречаетесь?

--- PAGE END ---


--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 2429
- Вон там, за ручейком.

--- PAGE END ---


--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 2430
Он, кстати, очень любит сов. Тушёных, с чесноком.

--- PAGE END ---


--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 2431
Тушёных, говоришь? Ну, я спешу… дела…

--- PAGE END ---


--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 2432
Прощай, мышонок! – и сова умчалась как стрела.

Гулял мышонок по лесу, и вдруг змея шуршит,

--- PAGE END ---


--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 2436
А у змеи, как водится, прекрасный аппетит.

--- PAGE END ---


--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 2437

--- PAGE END ---


--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 2438
Там сможем мы отлично поужинать с тобой.

--- PAGE START ---

Я с Груффало поужинать сегодня обещал.

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 2441
- Што-што? Какое груффало? Мышонок, ты о ком?

--- PAGE END ---


--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 2442
- О, это очень крупный зверь, я с ним давно знаком:

--- PAGE END ---


--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 2443
Глаза огнём горят, язык черней черники,

--- PAGE END ---


--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 2444
В шипах лиловых вся спина, и вид ужасно дикий!

--- PAGE END ---


--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 2445
- А где вы с ним встречаетесь?

--- PAGE END ---


--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 2446
- Тут рядом, на пруду.
--- PAGE END ---


--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 2447
Он, кстати, очень любит змей. В сметане и в меду.

--- PAGE END ---


--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 2448
- В сметане, говоришь? Ну, мне пора в постель.

--- PAGE END ---


--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 2449
Прощай, мышонок! – и змея в свою скользнула щель.

--- PAGE END ---


--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 2450
- Ха, глупая змея, не знает ничего!

--- PAGE END ---


--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 2451
Спасибо, выдумка моя, спасибо, груффа……Ой!

--- PAGE END ---


--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 2452
Как этот страшный зверь сумел сюда попасть?

--- PAGE END ---



--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 2453
Какие острые клыки, чудовищная пасть!

--- PAGE END ---



--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 2454
Ножищи, как столбы… на них когтищи в ряд…

--- PAGE END ---


--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 2455

#TITLE: 2458
Ой мама, это груффало!

--- PAGE END ---


--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 2459
Оно меня понюфало!

--- PAGE END ---


--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 2460
- Еда, - воскликнул Груффало, - сама шагает в рот!

--- PAGE END ---


--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 2461
Я положу тебя на хлеб, и выйдет бутерброд.

--- PAGE END ---


--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 2462
- Меня на хлеб? Да я такой… - мышонок пропищал, -

--- PAGE END ---


--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 2463
Я самый страшный зверь лесной, я всех тут застращал!

--- PAGE END ---


--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 2464
А ну, пошли со мною, сейчас увидишь ты,

--- PAGE END ---


--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 2465
Как от меня все звери бросаются в кусты!

--- PAGE END ---


--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 2466
- Ну что ж… ха-ха… веди! Взгляну, потехи ради.

--- PAGE END ---


--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 2467
Ты топай впереди, а я тихонько сзади.

--- PAGE END ---


--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 2468
Вот по лесу они вдвоём шагают не спеша,

--- PAGE END ---


--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 2469
И вдруг шипенье слышится и шорох камыша.

--- PAGE END ---


--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 2470
- Да это же Змея! – мышонок закричал. –

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 2471
Привет, не виделись сто лет, я даже заскучал!

--- PAGE END ---


--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 2472
Змея сказала: «Мамочки! На помощь! Караул!»,

--- PAGE END ---


--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 2473
Под кучу брёвен заползла – и только хвост мелькнул.

--- PAGE END ---


--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 2474
- Ну как? – спросил мышонок, - что скажешь ты теперь?

--- PAGE END ---


--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 2475
- Да, это удивительно, - промолвил страшный зверь.

--- PAGE END ---


--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 2476
Вот через лес они опять шагают друг за дружкой,

--- PAGE END ---


--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 2477
И вдруг заухало в ветвях над самою опушкой.

--- PAGE END ---


--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 2478
- Да это же Сова! – мышонок закричал. –

--- PAGE END ---


--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 2479
Здорово, бабушка, давно тебя я не встречал!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 2480
Сова сказала: «Батюшки! Спасите… Не могу…»,

--- PAGE END ---


--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 2481
Забилась в тёмное дупло и больше ни гу-гу.

--- PAGE END ---


--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 2482
- Ну как? – спросил мышонок, - что скажешь ты теперь?

--- PAGE END ---


--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 2483
- Да, это поразительно! - воскликнул страшный зверь.

--- PAGE END ---


--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 2484
И вот опять они вдвоём идут лесной тропинкой.

--- PAGE END ---


--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 2485
Что там за рыжее пятно мелькнуло за осинкой?

--- PAGE END ---


--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 2486
- Эй, тётушка Лиса! – мышонок закричал. –

--- PAGE END ---


--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 2487
Ты что же в гости не идёшь, я даже осерчал.

--- PAGE END ---


--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 2488
Лиса сказала: «Это он! Спасите… Нету сил…»,

--- PAGE END ---


--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 2489
И мигом юркнула в нору, и след её простыл.

--- PAGE END ---


--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 2490
- Ну вот, – сказал мышонок, - не правда ли, теперь

--- PAGE END ---


--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 2491
Ты убедился, что в лесу я самый страшный зверь?

--- PAGE END ---


--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 2492
Но я проголодался… Эх, что ни говори,

--- PAGE END ---


--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 2493
Всего вкуснее груффало с орешками внутри!

--- PAGE START ---

- Простите, тётушка Лиса, - мышонок пропищал,

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 2606
- Я завтракаю с Груффало: я твёрдо обещал.

--- PAGE END ---


--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 2607
- Что там ещё за груффало? Мышонок, ты о ком?

--- PAGE END ---


--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 2608
- О, это очень крупный зверь, я с ним давно знаком:

--- PAGE END ---


--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 2609
Есть у него клыки, и когти тоже есть,

--- PAGE END ---


--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 2610
И преогромнейшая пасть, а в ней зубов не счесть.

--- PAGE END ---


--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 2611
- И где же вы встречаетесь?

--- PAGE END ---


--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 2612
- Да вон у той горушки.

--- PAGE END ---


--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 2613
Он, кстати, очень любит лис. С приправой из петрушки.

--- PAGE END ---


--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 2614
- С приправой, говоришь? Ну, мне пора домой.

--- PAGE END ---


--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 2615
Прощай, мышонок! – и лиса нырнула в лес густой.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 2616
- Ха, глупая лиса! Не знает ничего!

--- PAGE END ---


--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 2617
Нет никакого груффало, я выдумал его.

--- PAGE END ---


--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 2618
Гулял мышонок по лесу, и вдруг сова летит,

--- PAGE END ---


--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 2619
А у совы, как водится, отменный аппетит.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 2620
- Летим со мною, лёгонький, летим ко мне в дупло,

--- PAGE END ---


--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 2621
Там стол обеденный накрыт, там сухо и тепло.

--- PAGE END ---


--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 2622
- Простите, бабушка Сова, - мышонок пропищал, - 

--- PAGE END ---


--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 2623
Я пообедать с Груффало сегодня обещал.

--- PAGE END ---


--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 2624
- Какое ещё груффало? Мышонок, ты о ком?

--- PAGE END ---


--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 2625
- О, это очень крупный зверь, я с ним давно знаком:

--- PAGE END ---


--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 2626
Ножищи, как столбы! На них когтищи в ряд!

--- PAGE END ---


--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 2627
И бородавка на носу, а в бородавке – яд!

--- PAGE END ---


--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 2628
- А где вы с ним встречаетесь?

--- PAGE END ---


--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 2629
- Вон там, за ручейком.

--- PAGE END ---


--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 2630
Он, кстати, очень любит сов. Тушёных, с чесноком.

--- PAGE END ---


--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 2631
Тушёных, говоришь? Ну, я спешу… дела…

--- PAGE END ---


--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 2632
Прощай, мышонок! – и сова умчалась как стрела.

#TITLE: 2634

#TITLE: 2635
Гулял мышонок по лесу, и вдруг змея шуршит,

--- PAGE END ---


--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 2636
А у змеи, как водится, прекрасный аппетит.

--- PAGE END ---


--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 2637
- Пошли со мною, мягонький, пошли ко мне домой,

--- PAGE END ---


--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 2638
Там сможем мы отлично поужинать с тобой.

--- PAGE END ---


--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 2639
- Простите, госпожа Змея, - мышонок пропищал, -

--- PAGE END ---


--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 2640
Я с Груффало поужинать сегодня обещал.

--- PAGE END ---


--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 2641
- Што-што? Какое груффало? Мышонок, ты о ком?

--- PAGE END ---


--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 2642
- О, это очень крупный зверь, я с ним давно знаком:

--- PAGE END ---


--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 2643
Глаза огнём горят, язык черней черники,

--- PAGE END ---


--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 2644
В шипах лиловых вся спина, и вид ужасно дикий!

--- PAGE END ---


--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 2645
- А где вы с ним встречаетесь?

--- PAGE END ---


--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 2646
- Тут рядом, на пруду.
--- PAGE END ---


--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 2647
Он, кстати, очень любит змей. В сметане и в меду.

--- PAGE END ---


--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 2648
- В сметане, говоришь? Ну, мне пора в постель.

--- PAGE END ---


--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 2649
Прощай, мышонок! – и змея в свою скользнула щель.

--- PAGE END ---


--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 2650
- Ха, глупая змея, не знает ничего!

--- PAGE END ---


--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 2651
Спасибо, выдумка моя, спасибо, груффа……Ой!

--- PAGE END ---


--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 2652
Как этот страшный зверь сумел сюда попасть?

--- PAGE END ---



--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 2653
Какие острые клыки, чудовищная пасть!

--- PAGE END ---



--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 2654
Ножищи, как столбы… на них когтищи в ряд…

--- PAGE END ---


--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 2655

--- PAGE END ---


--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 2658
Ой мама, это груффало!

--- PAGE END ---


--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 2659
Оно меня понюфало!

--- PAGE END ---


--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 2660
- Еда, - воскликнул Груффало, - сама шагает в рот!

--- PAGE END ---


--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 2661
Я положу тебя на хлеб, и выйдет бутерброд.

--- PAGE END ---


--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 2662
- Меня на хлеб? Да я такой… - мышонок пропищал, -

--- PAGE END ---


--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 2663
Я самый страшный зверь лесной, я всех тут застращал!

--- PAGE END ---


--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 2664
А ну, пошли со мною, сейчас увидишь ты,

--- PAGE END ---


--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 2665
Как от меня все звери бросаются в кусты!

--- PAGE END ---


--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 2666
- Ну что ж… ха-ха… веди! Взгляну, потехи ради.

--- PAGE END ---


--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 2667
Ты топай впереди, а я тихонько сзади.

--- PAGE END ---


--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 2668
Вот по лесу они вдвоём шагают не спеша,

--- PAGE END ---


--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 2669
И вдруг шипенье слышится и шорох камыша.

--- PAGE END ---


--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 2670
- Да это же Змея! – мышонок закричал. –

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 2671
Привет, не виделись сто лет, я даже заскучал!

--- PAGE END ---


--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 2672
Змея сказала: «Мамочки! На помощь! Караул!»,

--- PAGE END ---


--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 2673
Под кучу брёвен заползла – и только хвост мелькнул.

--- PAGE END ---


--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 2674
- Ну как? – спросил мышонок, - что скажешь ты теперь?

--- PAGE END ---


--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 2675
- Да, это удивительно, - промолвил страшный зверь.

--- PAGE END ---


--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 2676
Вот через лес они опять шагают друг за дружкой,

--- PAGE END ---


--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 2677
И вдруг заухало в ветвях над самою опушкой.

--- PAGE END ---


--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 2678
- Да это же Сова! – мышонок закричал. –

--- PAGE END ---


--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 2679
Здорово, бабушка, давно тебя я не встречал!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 2680
Сова сказала: «Батюшки! Спасите… Не могу…»,

--- PAGE END ---


--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 2681
Забилась в тёмное дупло и больше ни гу-гу.

--- PAGE END ---


--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 2682
- Ну как? – спросил мышонок, - что скажешь ты теперь?

--- PAGE END ---


--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 2683
- Да, это поразительно! - воскликнул страшный зверь.

--- PAGE END ---


--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 2684
И вот опять они вдвоём идут лесной тропинкой.

--- PAGE END ---


--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 2685
Что там за рыжее пятно мелькнуло за осинкой?

--- PAGE END ---


--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 2686
- Эй, тётушка Лиса! – мышонок закричал. –

--- PAGE END ---


--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 2687
Ты что же в гости не идёшь, я даже осерчал.

--- PAGE END ---


--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 2688
Лиса сказала: «Это он! Спасите… Нету сил…»,

--- PAGE END ---


--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 2689
И мигом юркнула в нору, и след её простыл.

--- PAGE END ---


--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 2690
- Ну вот, – сказал мышонок, - не правда ли, теперь

--- PAGE END ---


--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 2691
Ты убедился, что в лесу я самый страшный зверь?

--- PAGE END ---


--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 2692
Но я проголодался… Эх, что ни говори,

--- PAGE END ---


--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 2693
Всего вкуснее груффало с орешками внутри!

--- PAGE END ---


--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 2694
- С орешками внутри? Да это страшный сон!

--- PAGE END ---


--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 2695
И зверь пустился наутёк, и в чаще скрылся он.

--- PAGE END ---


--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 2696
Сидит мышонок на пеньке, орешками хрустит:

--- PAGE END ---


--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 2697
Ведь он сегодня нагулял отличный аппетит.

--- PAGE END ---


--- PAGE START ---

Мы сможем там отлично позавтракать вдвоём.

Прощай, мышонок! – и лиса нырнула в лес густой.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 2816
- Ха, глупая лиса! Не знает ничего!

--- PAGE END ---


--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 2817
Нет никакого груффало, я выдумал его.

--- PAGE END ---


--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 2818
Гулял мышонок по лесу, и вдруг сова летит,

--- PAGE END ---


--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 2819
А у совы, как водится, отменный аппетит.

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 2820
- Летим со мною, лёгонький, летим ко мне в дупло,

--- PAGE END ---


--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 2821
Там стол обеденный накрыт, там сухо и тепло.

--- PAGE END ---


--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 2822
- Простите, бабушка Сова, - мышонок пропищал, - 

--- PAGE END ---


--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 2823
Я пообедать с Груффало сегодня обещал.

--- PAGE END ---


--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 2824
- Какое ещё груффало? Мышонок, ты о ком?

--- PAGE END ---


--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 2825
- О, это очень крупный зверь, я с ним давно знаком:

--- PAGE END ---


--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 2826
Ножищи, как столбы! На них когтищи в ряд!

--- PAGE END ---


--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 2827
И бородавка на носу, а в бородавке – яд!

--- PAGE END ---


--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 2828
- А где вы с ним встречаетесь?

--- PAGE END ---


--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 2829
- Вон там, за ручейком.

--- PAGE END ---


--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 2830
Он, кстати, очень любит сов. Тушёных, с чесноком.

--- PAGE END ---


--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 2831
Тушёных, говоришь? Ну, я спешу… дела…

--- PAGE END ---


--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 2832
Прощай, мышонок! – и сова умчалась как стрела.

--- PAGE END ---


--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 2833

#TITLE: 2835
Гулял мышонок по лесу, и вдруг змея шуршит,

--- PAGE END ---


--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 2836
А у змеи, как водится, прекрасный аппетит.

--- PAGE END ---


--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 2837
- Пошли со мною, мягонький, пошли ко мне домой,

--- PAGE END ---


--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 2838
Там сможем мы отлично поужинать с тобой.

--- PAGE END ---


--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 2839
- Простите, госпожа Змея, - мышонок пропищал, -

--- PAGE END ---


--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 2840
Я с Груффало поужинать сегодня обещал.

--- PAGE END ---


--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 2841
- Што-што? Какое груффало? Мышонок, ты о ком?

--- PAGE END ---


--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 2842
- О, это очень крупный зверь, я с ним давно знаком:

--- PAGE END ---


--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 2843
Глаза огнём горят, язык черней черники,

--- PAGE END ---


--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 2844
В шипах лиловых вся спина, и вид ужасно дикий!

--- PAGE END ---


--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 2845
- А где вы с ним встречаетесь?

--- PAGE END ---


--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 2846
- Тут рядом, на пруду.
--- PAGE END ---


--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 2847
Он, кстати, очень любит змей. В сметане и в меду.

--- PAGE END ---


--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 2848
- В сметане, говоришь? Ну, мне пора в постель.

--- PAGE END ---


--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 2849
Прощай, мышонок! – и змея в свою скользнула щель.

--- PAGE END ---


--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 2850
- Ха, глупая змея, не знает ничего!

--- PAGE END ---


--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 2851
Спасибо, выдумка моя, спасибо, груффа……Ой!

--- PAGE END ---


--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 2852
Как этот страшный зверь сумел сюда попасть?

--- PAGE END ---



--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 2853
Какие острые клыки, чудовищная пасть!

--- PAGE END ---



--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 2854
Ножищи, как столбы… на них когтищи в ряд…

--- PAGE END ---


--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 2855
И бородавка на носу, а в бородавке – яд!

--- PAGE END ---

#TITLE: 2856
Глаза горят огнём, язык черней черники,

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 2857
В шипах лиловых вся спина, и вид ужасно дикий.

--- PAGE END ---


--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 2858
Ой мама, это груффало!

--- PAGE END ---


--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 2859
Оно меня понюфало!

--- PAGE END ---


--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 2860
- Еда, - воскликнул Груффало, - сама шагает в рот!

--- PAGE END ---


--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 2861
Я положу тебя на хлеб, и выйдет бутерброд.

--- PAGE END ---


--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 2862
- Меня на хлеб? Да я такой… - мышонок пропищал, -

--- PAGE END ---


--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 2863
Я самый страшный зверь лесной, я всех тут застращал!

--- PAGE END ---


--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 2864
А ну, пошли со мною, сейчас увидишь ты,

--- PAGE END ---


--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 2865
Как от меня все звери бросаются в кусты!

--- PAGE END ---


--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 2866
- Ну что ж… ха-ха… веди! Взгляну, потехи ради.

--- PAGE END ---


--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 2867
Ты топай впереди, а я тихонько сзади.

--- PAGE END ---


--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 2868
Вот по лесу они вдвоём шагают не спеша,

--- PAGE END ---


--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 2869
И вдруг шипенье слышится и шорох камыша.

--- PAGE END ---


--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 2870
- Да это же Змея! – мышонок закричал. –

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 2871
Привет, не виделись сто лет, я даже заскучал!

--- PAGE END ---


--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 2872
Змея сказала: «Мамочки! На помощь! Караул!»,

--- PAGE END ---


--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 2873
Под кучу брёвен заползла – и только хвост мелькнул.

--- PAGE END ---


--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 2874
- Ну как? – спросил мышонок, - что скажешь ты теперь?

--- PAGE END ---


--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 2875
- Да, это удивительно, - промолвил страшный зверь.

--- PAGE END ---


--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 2876
Вот через лес они опять шагают друг за дружкой,

--- PAGE END ---


--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 2877
И вдруг заухало в ветвях над самою опушкой.

--- PAGE END ---


--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 2878
- Да это же Сова! – мышонок закричал. –

--- PAGE END ---


--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 2879
Здорово, бабушка, давно тебя я не встречал!

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 2880
Сова сказала: «Батюшки! Спасите… Не могу…»,

--- PAGE END ---


--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 2881
Забилась в тёмное дупло и больше ни гу-гу.

--- PAGE END ---


--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 2882
- Ну как? – спросил мышонок, - что скажешь ты теперь?

--- PAGE END ---


--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 2883
- Да, это поразительно! - воскликнул страшный зверь.

--- PAGE END ---


--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 2884
И вот опять они вдвоём идут лесной тропинкой.

--- PAGE END ---


--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 2885
Что там за рыжее пятно мелькнуло за осинкой?

--- PAGE END ---


--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 2886
- Эй, тётушка Лиса! – мышонок закричал. –

--- PAGE END ---


--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 2887
Ты что же в гости не идёшь, я даже осерчал.

--- PAGE END ---


--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 2888
Лиса сказала: «Это он! Спасите… Нету сил…»,

--- PAGE END ---


--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 2889
И мигом юркнула в нору, и след её простыл.

--- PAGE END ---


--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 2890
- Ну вот, – сказал мышонок, - не правда ли, теперь

--- PAGE END ---


--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 2891
Ты убедился, что в лесу я самый страшный зверь?

--- PAGE END ---


--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 2892
Но я проголодался… Эх, что ни говори,

--- PAGE END ---


--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 2893
Всего вкуснее груффало с орешками внутри!

--- PAGE END ---


--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 2894
- С орешками внутри? Да это страшный сон!

--- PAGE END ---


--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 2895
И зверь пустился наутёк, и в чаще скрылся он.

--- PAGE END ---


--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 2896
Сидит мышонок на пеньке, орешками хрустит:

--- PAGE END ---


--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 2897
Ведь он сегодня нагулял отличный аппетит.

--- PAGE END ---


--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 2898

--- PAGE START ---

Гулял мышонок по лесу, и вдруг лиса бежит,

--- PAGE END ---

--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 2902
А у лисы, как водится, хороший аппетит.

--- PAGE END ---


--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 2903
- Пойдём со мною, маленький, в нору ко мне пойдём,

--- PAGE END ---


--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 2904
Мы сможем там отлично позавтракать вдвоём.

--- PAGE END ---


--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 2905
- Простите, тётушка Лиса, - мышонок пропищал,

--- PAGE END ---


--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 2906
- Я завтракаю с Груффало: я твёрдо обещал.

--- PAGE END ---


--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 2907
- Что там ещё за груффало? Мышонок, ты о ком?

--- PAGE END ---


--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 2908
- О, это очень крупный зверь, я с ним давно знаком:

--- PAGE END ---


--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 2909
Есть у него клыки, и когти тоже есть,

--- PAGE END ---


--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 2910
И преогромнейшая пасть, а в ней зубов не счесть.

--- PAGE END ---


--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 2911
- И где же вы встречаетесь?

--- PAGE END ---


--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 2912
- Да вон у той горушки.

--- PAGE END ---


--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 2913
Он, кстати, очень любит лис. С приправой из петрушки.

--- PAGE END ---


--- PAGE START ---
#TITLE: 2914
- С приправой, говоришь? Ну, мне пора домой.

--- PAGE END ---
